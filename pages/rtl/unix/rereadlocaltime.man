.SH NAME
ReReadLocalTime - Re-Read the local time files.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBUnix\fR, file \fBunix.pp\fR, line 74
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBReReadLocalTime\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReReadLocalTime\fR can be used to re-initialize the local timezone information.

To speed up conversion of epoch (UTC) time to local time, the timezone information is loaded only once, at program startup. Calling this routine re-reads the timezone information using current timezone settings.

The \fBEpochToLocal\fR function uses timezone information to transform epoch time to local time. This timezone information does not change while the application is running: in particular, on DST transitions or when the timezone files change, the time returned by local time routines will be wrong.
