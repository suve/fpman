.SH NAME
FSearch - Search for file in search path.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBUnix\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFSearch\fR(\fBconst\fR path:AnsiString; dirlist:Ansistring; CurrentDirStrategy:TFSearchOption):AnsiString;

function \fBFSearch\fR(\fBconst\fR path:AnsiString; dirlist:AnsiString):AnsiString;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFSearch\fR searches in \fBDirList\fR, a colon separated list of directories, for a file named \fBPath\fR. It then returns a path to the found file.

The \fBCurrentDirStrategy\fR determines how the current directory is treated when searching:

.TP
.B NoCurrentDirectory
Do not search the current directory unless it is specified in the search path.
.TP
.B CurrentDirectoryFirst
Search the current directory first, before all directories in the search path.
.TP
.B CurrentDirectoryLast
Search the current directory last, after all directories in the search path
.TP 0
It is mainly provided to mimic DOS search path behaviour. Default behaviour is to search the current directory first.


.SH ERRORS
An empty string if no such file was found.


.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B #rtl.unixutil.FNMatch
Check whether filename matches wildcard specification
