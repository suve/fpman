procedure \fBClose\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file);

procedure \fBClose\fR(\fBvar\fR t:Text);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBClose\fR flushes the buffer of the file \fBF\fR and closes \fBF\fR. After a call to \fBClose\fR, data can no longer be read from or written to \fBF\fR. To reopen a file closed with \fBClose\fR, it isn't necessary to assign the file again. A call to \fBReset\fR or \fBRewrite\fR is sufficient.


.SH ERRORS
Depending on the state of the \fB{$I}\fR switch, a runtime error can be generated if there is an error. In the \fB{$I-}\fR state, use \fBIOResult\fR to check for errors.
