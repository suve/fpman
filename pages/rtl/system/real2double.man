.SH NAME
Real2Double - Convert Turbo Pascal style real to double.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBmathh.inc\fR, line 91
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBReal2Double\fR(r:real48):Double;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBReal2Double\fR function converts a Turbo Pascal style real (6 bytes long) to a native Free Pascal double type. It can be used e.g. to read old binary TP files with FPC and convert them to Free Pacal binary files.

Note that the assignment operator has been overloaded so a \fBReal48\fR type can be assigned directly to a double or extended.


.SH ERRORS
None.
