.SH NAME
BlockWrite - Write data from memory to an untyped file
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:Int64; \fBvar\fR Result:Int64);

procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:LongInt; \fBvar\fR Result:LongInt);

procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:Cardinal; \fBvar\fR Result:Cardinal);

procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:Word; \fBvar\fR Result:Word);

procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:Word; \fBvar\fR Result:Integer);

procedure \fBBlockWrite\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file; \fBconst\fR Buf; Count:LongInt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBBlockWrite\fR writes \fBcount\fR records from \fBbuffer\fR to the file \fBF\fR.A record is a block of bytes with size specified by the \fBRewrite\fR or \fBReset\fR statement. If the records couldn't be written to disk, a run-time error is generated. This behavior can be controlled by the \fB{$I}\fR switch.


.SH ERRORS
Depending on the state of the \fB{$I}\fR switch, a runtime error can be generated if there is an error. In the \fB{$I-}\fR state, use \fBIOResult\fR to check for errors.
