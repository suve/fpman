.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBsystemh.inc\fR, line 925
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFileSize\fR(\fBvar\fR f:file):Int64;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFilesize\fR returns the total number of records in file \fBF\fR. It cannot be invoked with a file of type \fBText\fR. (under linux and unix, this also means that it cannot be invoked on pipes). If \fBF\fR is empty, 0 is returned. Untyped files have a default record size of 128, if the second parameter to \fBReset\fR isn't specified.


.SH ERRORS
Depending on the state of the \fB{$I}\fR switch, a runtime error can be generated if there is an error. In the \fB{$I-}\fR state, use \fBIOResult\fR to check for errors.
