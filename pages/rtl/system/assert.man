.SH NAME
Assert - Check validity of a given condition.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBAssert\fR(Expr:Boolean);

procedure \fBAssert\fR(Expr:Boolean; \fBconst\fR Msg:string);
.SH DESCRIPTION
With assertions on, \fBAssert\fR tests if \fBexpr\fR is false, and if so, aborts the application with a Runtime error 227 and an optional error message in \fBmsg\fR. If \fBexpr\fR is true, program execution continues normally. If assertions are not enabled at compile time, this routine does nothing, and no code is generated for the \fBAssert\fR call. Enabling and disabling assertions at compile time is done via the \fB\\$C\fR or \fB\\$ASSERTIONS\fR compiler switches. These are global switches. The default behavior of the assert call can be changed by setting a new handler in the \fBAssertErrorProc\fR variable. Sysutils overrides the default handler to raise a \fBEAssertionFailed\fR exception.


.SH ERRORS
None.
