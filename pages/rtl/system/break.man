procedure \fBBreak\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBBreak\fR jumps to the statement following the end of the current repetitive statement. The code between the \fBBreak\fR call and the end of the repetitive statement is skipped. The condition of the repetitive statement is NOT evaluated.

This can be used with \fBFor\fR, var{repeat} and \fBWhile\fR statements.

Note that while this is a procedure, \fBBreak\fR is a reserved word and hence cannot be redefined.
