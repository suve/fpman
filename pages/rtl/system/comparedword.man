.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBCompareDWord\fR(\fBconst\fR buf1; \fBconst\fR buf2; len:SizeInt):SizeInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCompareDWord\fR compares two memory regions \fBbuf1\fR,\fBbuf2\fR on a DWord-per-DWord basis for a total of \fBlen\fR DWords. (A DWord is 4 bytes).

The function returns one of the following values:

.TP
.B -1
if \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR contain different DWords in the first \fBlen\fR DWords, and the first such DWord is smaller in \fBbuf1\fR than the DWord at the same position in \fBbuf2\fR.
.TP
.B 0
if the first \fBlen\fR DWords in \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR are equal.
.TP
.B 1
if \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR contain different DWords in the first \fBlen\fR DWords, and the first such DWord is larger in \fBbuf1\fR than the DWord at the same position in \fBbuf2\fR.

.SH ERRORS
None.
