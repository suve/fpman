.SH NAME
Read - Read from a text file into variable
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBRead\fR(\fBvar\fR F:Text; Args:Arguments);

procedure \fBRead\fR(Args:Arguments);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRead\fR reads one or more values from a file \fBF\fR, and stores the result in \fBV1\fR, \fBV2\fR, etc.; If no file \fBF\fR is specified, then standard input is read. If \fBF\fR is of type \fBText\fR, then the variables \fBV1, V2\fR etc. must be of type \fBChar\fR, \fBInteger\fR, \fBReal\fR, \fBString\fR. If \fBF\fR is a typed file, then each of the variables must be of the type specified in the declaration of \fBF\fR. Untyped files are not allowed as an argument.

In earlier versions of FPC, it was also allowed to read \fBPchar\fR null-terminated strings, but this has been removed, since there is no buffer checking possible.


.SH ERRORS
If no data is available, empty values are returned (0 for ordinal values, empty strings for string values)
