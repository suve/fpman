.SH NAME
CompareChar - ompare 2 memory buffers character per character
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBsystemh.inc\fR, line 547
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBCompareChar\fR(\fBconst\fR buf1; \fBconst\fR buf2; len:SizeInt):SizeInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCompareChar\fR compares two memory regions \fBbuf1\fR,\fBbuf2\fR on a character-per-character basis for a total of \fBlen\fR characters.

The \fBCompareChar0\fR variant compares \fBlen\fR bytes, or until a zero character is found.

The function returns one of the following values:

.TP
.B -1
if \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR contain different characters in the first \fBlen\fR positions, and the first such character is smaller in \fBbuf1\fR than the character at the same position in \fBbuf2\fR.
.TP
.B 0
if the first \fBlen\fR characters in \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR are equal.
.TP
.B 1
if \fBbuf1\fR and \fBbuf2\fR contain different characters in the first \fBlen\fR positions, and the first such character is larger in \fBbuf1\fR than the character at the same position in \fBbuf2\fR.

.SH ERRORS
None.
