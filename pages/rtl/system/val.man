.SH NAME
Val - Calculate numerical/enumerated value of a string.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBsystem.fpd\fR, line 57
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBVal\fR(\fBconst\fR S:string; \fBvar\fR V; \fBvar\fR Code:Word);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBVal\fR converts the value represented in the string \fBS\fR to a numerical value or an enumerated value, and stores this value in the variable \fBV\fR, which can be of type \fBLongint\fR, \fBReal\fR and \fBByte\fR or any enumerated type. If the conversion isn't succesfull, then the parameter \fBCode\fR contains the index of the character in \fBS\fR which prevented the conversion. The string \fBS\fR is allowed to contain spaces in the beginning.

The string \fBS\fR can contain a number in decimal, hexadecimal, binary or octal format, as described in the language reference. For enumerated values, the string must be the name of the enumerated value. The name is searched case insensitively.

For hexadecimal values, the prefix '0x' or 'x' (case insensitive) may be used as well.

The conversion to enumerated exists only as of version 2.3.1 (or later) of the compiler.


.SH ERRORS
If the conversion doesn't succeed, the value of \fBCode\fR indicates the position where the conversion went wrong. The value of \fBV\fR is then undefined.
