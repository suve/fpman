.SH NAME
WriteLn - Write variable to a text file and append newline
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBWriteln\fR(Args:Arguments);

procedure \fBWriteLn\fR(\fBvar\fR F:Text; Args:Arguments);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWriteLn\fR does the same as \fBWrite\fR for text files, and emits a Carriage Return - LineFeed character pair after that. If the parameter \fBF\fR is omitted, standard output is assumed. If no variables are specified, a Carriage Return - LineFeed character pair is emitted, resulting in a new line in the file \fBF\fR.

\fIRemark:\fR Under linux and unix, the Carriage Return character is omitted, as customary in Unix environments.

\fIRemark:\fR When writing string variables, no codepage conversions are done. The string is copied as-is to the file descriptor. In particular, for console output, it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure that the codepage of the string matches the codepage of the console.


.SH ERRORS
If an error occurs, a run-time error is generated. This behavior can be controlled with the \fB{$I}\fR switch.
