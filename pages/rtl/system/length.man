.SH NAME
Length - Returns length of a string or array.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBLength\fR(S:AStringType):Integer;

function \fBLength\fR(A:DynArrayType):Integer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLength\fR returns the length of the string or array \fBS\fR, which is limited to 255 for shortstrings. If the string \fBS\fR is empty, 0 is returned.

\fINote:\fR The length of the string \fBS\fR is stored in \fBS[0]\fR for shortstrings only. The \fBLength\fR function should always be used on ansistrings and widestrings.

For dynamical or statical arrays, the function returns the number of elements in the array.

\fBLength\fR also supports arguments of type \fBPChar\fR and \fBPWideChar\fR, in which case it is identical to the \fBStrLen\fR and \fBWStrLen\fR functions, respectively. In this case, the function actually calculates the length of the null-terminated string, and its execution time is proportional to the string length because the terminating null character is searched through a linear scan.


.SH ERRORS
None.
