.SH NAME
SetTextBuf - Set size of text file internal buffer
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBSetTextBuf\fR(\fBvar\fR f:Text; \fBvar\fR Buf


; \fBvar\fR f:Text; \fBvar\fR Buf; Size:SizeInt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSetTextBuf\fR assigns an I/O buffer to a text file. The new buffer is located at \fBBuf\fR and is \fBSize\fR bytes long. If \fBSize\fR is omitted, then \fBSizeOf(Buf)\fR is assumed. The standard buffer of any text file is 128 bytes long. For heavy I/O operations this may prove too slow. The \fBSetTextBuf\fR procedure allows to set a bigger buffer for the I/O of the application, thus reducing the number of system calls, and thus reducing the load on the system resources. The maximum size of the newly assigned buffer is 65355 bytes.

\fIRemark:\fR


\fB\[bu]\fR Never assign a new buffer to an opened file. A new buffer can be assigned immediately after a call to Rewrite, Reset or \fBAppend\fR, but not after the file was read from/written to. This may cause loss of data. If a new buffer must be assigned after read/write operations have been performed, the file should be flushed first. This will ensure that the current buffer is emptied.

   \fB\[bu]\fR Take care that the assigned buffer is always valid. If a local variable is assigned as a buffer, then after the program exits the local program block, the buffer will no longer be valid, and stack problems may occur.




.SH ERRORS
No checking on \fBSize\fR is done.
