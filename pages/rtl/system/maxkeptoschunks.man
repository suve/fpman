.SH NAME
MaxKeptOSChunks - Maximum number of OS chunks to be kept in memory
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBheaph.inc\fR, line 60
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconst\fR MaxKeptOSChunks: \fBDWord\fR = 4;

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMaxKeptOSChunks\fR tells the heap manager how many free chunks of OS-allocated memory it should keep in memory. When freeing memory, it can happen that a memory block obtained from the OS is completely free. If more than \fBMaxKeptOSChunks\fR such blocks are free, then the heap manager will return them to the OS, to reduce memory requirements.
