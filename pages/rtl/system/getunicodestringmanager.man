.SH NAME
GetUnicodeStringManager - Return a copy of the currently active unicodetring manager.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR, file \fBustringh.inc\fR, line 124
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBGetUnicodeStringManager\fR(\fBvar\fR Manager:TUnicodeStringManager);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGetUnicodeStringManager\fR returns a copy of the currently active unicode string manager in \fBOld\fR 

UnicodeStrings are implemented in different ways on different platforms. Therefore, the Free Pascal Runtime library has no fixed implementation of widestring routines. Instead, it defines a UnicodeStringManager record, with callbacks that can be set to an implementation which is most efficient on the current platform. On windows, standard Windows routines will be used. On Unix and Linux, an implementation based on the C library is available (in unit \fBcwstring\fR).

It is possible to implement a custom unicodestring manager, optimized for the current application, without having to recompile the complete Run-Time Library.
