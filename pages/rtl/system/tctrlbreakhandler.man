.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTCtrlBreakHandler\fR is the prototype for the CTRL-C handler. If \fBCtrlBreak\fR is \fBTrue\fR then Ctrl-Break was hit, otherwise \fBCTRL-C\fR was hit. The handlers should return \fBTrue\fR to signal that the key-combination was handled. If \fBFalse\fR is returned, then default handling will be used, which by default means an exception will be raised if the sysutils unit is used.
