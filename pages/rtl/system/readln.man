.SH NAME
ReadLn - Read from a text file into variable and goto next line
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSystem\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBReadLn\fR(\fBvar\fR F:Text; Args:Arguments);

procedure \fBReadLn\fR(Args:Arguments);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRead\fR reads one or more values from a file \fBF\fR, and stores the result in \fBV1\fR, \fBV2\fR, etc. After that it goes to the next line in the file. The end of the line is marked by any of the supported line ending styles, independent of the platform on which the code is running (supported line ending styles are CRLF, LF or CR). The end-of-line marker is not considered part of the line and is ignored.

If no file \fBF\fR is specified, then standard input is read. The variables \fBV1, V2\fR etc. must be of type \fBChar\fR, \fBInteger\fR, \fBReal\fR, \fBString\fR or \fBPChar\fR.

For an example, see \fBRead\fR.


.SH ERRORS
If no data is available, empty values are returned (0 for ordinal values, empty strings for string values)
