.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBsysstrh.inc\fR, line 77
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBCompareMemRange\fR(P1:Pointer; P2:Pointer; Length:PtrUInt):Integer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCompareMemRange\fR compares the 2 memory locations pointed to by \fBP1\fR and \fBP2\fR byte per byte. It stops comparing after \fBLength\fR bytes have been compared, or when it has encountered 2 different bytes. The result is then

.TP
.B >0
if a byte in range \fBP1\fR was found that is bigger than the corresponding byte in range \fBP2\fR.
.TP
.B 0
if all bytes in range \fBP1\fR are the same as the corresponding bytes in range \fBP2\fR.
.TP
.B <0
if a byte in range \fBP1\fR was found that is less than the corresponding byte in range \fBP2\fR.

.SH ERRORS
None.
