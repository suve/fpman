pcharfunctions - PChar related functions
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Most PChar functions are the same as their counterparts in the \fBSTRINGS\fR unit. The following functions are the same :


\fB1.\fR StrCat : Concatenates two \fBPChar\fR strings.

\fB2.\fR StrComp : Compares two \fBPChar\fR strings.

\fB3.\fR StrCopy : Copies a \fBPChar\fR string.

\fB4.\fR StrECopy : Copies a \fBPChar\fR string and returns a pointer to the terminating null byte.

\fB5.\fR StrEnd : Returns a pointer to the terminating null byte.

\fB6.\fR StrIComp : Case insensitive compare of 2 \fBPChar\fR strings.

\fB7.\fR StrLCat : Appends at most L characters from one \fBPChar\fR to another \fBPChar\fR.

\fB8.\fR StrLComp : Case sensitive compare of at most L characters of 2 \fBPChar\fR strings.

\fB9.\fR StrLCopy : Copies at most L characters from one \fBPChar\fR to another.

\fB10.\fR StrLen : Returns the length (exclusive terminating null byte) of a \fBPChar\fR string.

\fB11.\fR StrLIComp : Case insensitive compare of at most L characters of 2 \fBPChar\fR strings.

\fB12.\fR StrLower : Converts a \fBPChar\fR to all lowercase letters.

\fB13.\fR StrMove : Moves one \fBPChar\fR to another.

\fB14.\fR StrNew : Makes a copy of a \fBPChar\fR on the heap, and returns a pointer to this copy.

\fB15.\fR StrPos : Returns the position of one \fBPChar\fR string in another?

\fB16.\fR StrRScan : returns a pointer to the last occurrence of on \fBPChar\fR string in another one.

\fB17.\fR StrScan : returns a pointer to the first occurrence of on \fBPChar\fR string in another one.

\fB18.\fR StrUpper : Converts a \fBPChar\fR to all uppercase letters.

The subsequent functions are different from their counterparts in \fBSTRINGS\fR, although the same examples can be used.
