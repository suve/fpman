.SH NAME
FindNext - Find the next entry in a findhandle.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBfilutilh.inc\fR, line 97
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFindNext\fR(\fBvar\fR Rslt:TSearchRec):LongInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFindNext\fR finds a next occurrence of a search sequence initiated by \fBFindFirst\fR. If another record matching the criteria in Rslt is found, 0 is returned, a nonzero constant is returned otherwise.

\fIRemark:\fR The last \fBFindNext\fR call must \fIalways\fR be followed by a \fBFindClose\fR call with the same \fBRslt\fR record. Failure to do so will result in memory loss.

For an example, see \fBFindFirst\fR


.SH ERRORS
On error (no more file is found), a nonzero constant is returned.
