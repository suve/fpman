.SH NAME
CreateGUID - Create a new GUID
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBsysutilh.inc\fR, line 233
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBCreateGUID\fR(\fBout\fR GUID:TGuid):Integer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreateGUID\fR can be called to create a new GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) value. The function returns the new \fBGUID\fR value in \fBGUID\fR and returns zero in case the GUID was created succesfully. If no GUID was created, a nonzero error code is returned.

The default mechanism for creating a new GUID is system dependent. If operating system support is available, it is used. If none is available, a default implementation using random numbers is used.

The \fBOnCreateGUID\fR callback can be set to hook a custom mechanism behind the \fBCreateGUID\fR function. This can be used to lt the GUID be created by an external GUID creation library.


.SH ERRORS
On error, a nonzero return value is returned.
