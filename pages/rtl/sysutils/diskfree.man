.SH NAME
DiskFree - Return the amount of free diskspace
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBdiskh.inc\fR, line 16
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBDiskFree\fR(drive:Byte):Int64;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDiskFree\fR returns the free space (in bytes) on disk \fBDrive\fR. Drive is the number of the disk drive:

.TP
.B 0
for the current drive.
.TP
.B 1
for the first floppy drive.
.TP
.B 2
for the second floppy drive.
.TP
.B 3
for the first hard-disk partition.
.TP
.B 4-26
for all other drives and partitions.
.TP 0
\fIRemark:\fR Under Linux, and Unix in general, the concept of disk is different than the dos one, since the filesystem is seen as one big directory tree. For this reason, the \fBDiskFree\fR and DiskSize functions must be mimicked using filenames that reside on the partitions. For more information, see AddDisk.


.SH ERRORS
On error, \fB-1\fR is returned.


.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B DiskSize
Return the total amount of diskspace.
.TP
.B AddDisk
Add a disk to the list of known disks (Unix only)
