.SH NAME
StrAlloc - Allocate a null-terminated string on the heap.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBsyspchh.inc\fR, line 41
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBStrAlloc\fR(Size:Cardinal):PChar;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBStrAlloc\fR reserves memory on the heap for a string with length \fBLen\fR, terminating \fB#0\fR included, and returns a pointer to it.

Additionally, \fBStrAlloc\fR allocates 4 extra bytes to store the size of the allocated memory. Therefore this function is NOT compatible with the \fBStrAlloc\fR function of the \fBStrings\fR unit.

For an example, see \fBStrBufSize\fR.


.SH ERRORS
None.
