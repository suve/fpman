.SH LOCATION

.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFileSeek\fR(Handle:THandle; FOffset:LongInt; Origin:LongInt):LongInt;

function \fBFileSeek\fR(Handle:THandle; FOffset:Int64; Origin:LongInt):Int64;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFileSeek\fR sets the file pointer on position \fBOffset\fR, starting from \fBOrigin\fR. Origin can be one of the following values:

.TP
.B fsFromBeginning
\fBOffset\fR is relative to the first byte of the file. This position is zero-based. i.e. the first byte is at offset 0.
.TP
.B fsFromCurrent
\fBOffset\fR is relative to the current position.
.TP
.B fsFromEnd
\fBOffset\fR is relative to the end of the file. This means that \fBOffset\fR can only be zero or negative in this case.
.TP 0
If successfull, the function returns the new file position, relative to the beginning of the file.

\fIRemark:\fR The abovementioned constants do not exist in Delphi.
