.SH NAME
InquireSignal - Check whether a signal handler is set (unix only)
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBsysutils.pp\fR, line 60
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBInquireSignal\fR(RtlSigNum:Integer):TSignalState;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRtlSigNum\fR will check whether the signal \fBRtlSigNum\fR is being handled, and by whom. It returns a \fBTSignalState\fR result to report the state of the signal, which can be one of the following values:

.TP
.B ssNotHooked
No signal handler is set for the signal.
.TP
.B ssHooked
A signal handler is set by the RTL code for the signal.
.TP
.B ssOverridden
A signal handler was set for the signal by third-party code.
.TP 0
This routine works by resetting the signal handlers, so it is risky to call.
