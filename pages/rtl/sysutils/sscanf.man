.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBSScanf\fR(\fBconst\fR s:string; \fBconst\fR fmt:string; \fBconst\fR Pointers):Integer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSSCanF\fR scans the string \fBS\fR for the elements specified in \fBFmt\fR, and returns the elements in the pointers in \fBPointers\fR. The \fBFmt\fR can contain placeholders of the form \fB%X\fR where \fBX\fR can be one of the following characters:

.TP
.B d
Placeholder for a decimal number.
.TP
.B f
Placeholder for a floating point number (an extended)
.TP
.B s
Placeholder for a string of arbitrary length.
.TP
.B c
Placeholder for a single character
.TP 0
The \fBPointers\fR array contains a list of pointers, each pointer should point to a memory location of a type that corresponds to the type of placeholder in that position:

.TP
.B d
A pointer to an integer.
.TP
.B f
A pointer to an extended.
.TP
.B s
A pointer to an ansistring.
