.SH NAME
AnsiStrUpper - Convert a null-terminated string to all-uppercase characters.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBsysstrh.inc\fR, line 93
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBAnsiStrUpper\fR(Str:PChar):PChar;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAnsiStrUpper\fR converts the \fBPChar\fR \fBStr\fR to uppercase characters and returns the resulting string. Note that \fBStr\fR itself is modified, not a copy, as in the case of \fBAnsiUpperCase\fR. It takes into account the operating system language settings when doing this, so special characters are converted correctly as well.

\fIRemark:\fR A widestring manager must be installed in order for this function to work correctly with various character sets.


.SH ERRORS
None.
