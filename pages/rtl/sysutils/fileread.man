.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBsysutils\fR, file \fBfilutilh.inc\fR, line 85
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFileRead\fR(Handle:THandle; \fBout\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt):LongInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFileRead\fR reads \fBCount\fR bytes from file-handle \fBHandle\fR and stores them into \fBBuffer\fR. Buffer must be at least \fBCount\fR bytes long. No checking on this is performed, so be careful not to overwrite any memory. \fBHandle\fR must be the result of a \fBFileOpen\fR call.

The function returns the number of bytes actually read, or -1 on error.

For an example, see \fBFileCreate\fR


.SH ERRORS
On error, -1 is returned.
