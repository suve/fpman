.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBAssignLst\fR(\fBvar\fR F:text; ToFile:string);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAssignLst\fR assigns to \fBF\fR a printing device - \fIUNIX only\fR. \fBToFile\fR is a string with the following form:


\fB\[bu]\fR \fB'|filename options'\fR : This sets up a pipe with the program filename, with the given options, such as in the popen() call.

\fB\[bu]\fR \fB'filename'\fR : Prints to file filename. Filename can contain the string 'PID' (No Quotes), which will be replaced by the PID of your program. When closing lst, the file will be sent to lpr and deleted. (lpr should be in PATH)

\fB\[bu]\fR \fB{'filename|'}\fR : Same as previous, only the file is \fInot\fR sent to lpr, nor is it deleted. (useful for opening /dev/printer or for later printing)
