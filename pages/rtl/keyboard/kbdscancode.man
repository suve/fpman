package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBkeyboard\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Special physical keys are encoded with the DOS scan codes for these keys in the second byte of the \fBTKeyEvent\fR type. A complete list of scan codes can be found in the below table. This is the list of keys that is used by the default key event translation mechanism. When writing a keyboard driver, either these constants should be returned by the various key event functions, or the \fBTranslateKeyEvent\fR hook should be implemented by the driver.
