package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBSockets\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBConnect\fR(Sock:LongInt; \fBconst\fR addr:TInetSockAddr; \fBvar\fR SockIn:text; \fBvar\fR SockOut:text):Boolean;

function \fBConnect\fR(Sock:LongInt; \fBconst\fR addr:TInetSockAddr; \fBvar\fR SockIn:file; \fBvar\fR SockOut:file):Boolean;

function \fBConnect\fR(Sock:LongInt; \fBconst\fR addr:string; \fBvar\fR SockIn:text; \fBvar\fR SockOut:text):Boolean;

function \fBConnect\fR(Sock:LongInt; \fBconst\fR addr:string; \fBvar\fR SockIn:file; \fBvar\fR SockOut:file):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBConnect\fR opens a connection to a peer, whose address is described by \fBAddr\fR. \fBAddrLen\fR contains the length of the address. The type of \fBAddr\fR depends on the kind of connection you're trying to make, but is generally one of \fBTSockAddr\fR or \fBTUnixSockAddr\fR.

The forms of the \fBConnect\fR command with the \fBText\fR or \fBFile\fR arguments are equivalent to subsequently calling the regular \fBConnect\fR function and the \fBSock2Text\fR or \fBSock2File\fR functions. These functions return \fBTrue\fR if successfull, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.

The \fBConnect\fR function returns a file descriptor if the call was successfull, \fB-1\fR in case of error.


.SH ERRORS
On error, \fB-1\fR is returned and errors are reported in \fBSocketError\fR.
