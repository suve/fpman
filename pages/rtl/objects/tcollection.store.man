.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBTCollection.Store\fR(\fBvar\fR S:TStream);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBStore\fR writes the collection to the stream \fBS\fR. It does this by writeing the current \fBCount\fR, \fBLimit\fR and \fBDelta\fR to the stream, and then writing each item to the stream.

The contents of the stream are then suitable for instantiating another collection with \fBLoad\fR.

For an example, see \fBTCollection.Load\fR.


.SH ERRORS
Errors returned are those by \fBTStream.Put\fR.
