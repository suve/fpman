.SH NAME
TStrListMaker.Init - Instantiate a new instance of \fBTStrListMaker\fR 
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBObjects\fR, file \fBobjects.pp\fR, line 548
.SH SYNOPSIS
constructor \fBTStrListMaker.Init\fR(AStrSize:Sw_Word; AIndexSize:Sw_Word);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBInit\fR constructor creates a new instance of the \fBTstrListMaker\fR object. It allocates \fBAStrSize\fR bytes on the heap to hold all the strings you wish to store. It also allocates enough room for \fBAIndexSize\fR key description entries (of the type \fBTStrIndexrec\fR).

\fBAStrSize\fR must be large enough to contain all the strings you wish to store. If not enough memory is allocated, other memory will be overwritten. The same is true for \fBAIndexSize\fR : maximally \fBAIndexSize\fR strings can be written to the stream.


.SH ERRORS
None.


.SH SEE ALSO

.B TObject.Init
