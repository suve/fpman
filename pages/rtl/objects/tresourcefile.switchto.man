.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBObjects\fR, file \fBobjects.pp\fR, line 507
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBTResourceFile.SwitchTo\fR(AStream:PStream; Pack:Boolean):PStream;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSwitchTo\fR switches to a new stream to hold the resources in. \fBAStream\fR will be the new stream after the call to \fBSwitchTo\fR.

If \fBPack\fR is true, then all the known resources will be copied from the current stream to the new stream (\fBAStream\fR). If \fBPack\fR is \fBFalse\fR, then only the current resource is copied.

The return value is the value of the original stream: \fBStream\fR.

The \fBModified\fR flag is set as a consequence of this call.


.SH ERRORS
Errors returned can be those of \fBTStream.Read\fR and \fBTStream.Write\fR.
