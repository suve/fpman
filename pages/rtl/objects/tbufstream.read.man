.SH NAME
TBufStream.Read - Read data from the file to a buffer in memory.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBObjects\fR, file \fBobjects.pp\fR, line 350
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBTBufStream.Read\fR(\fBvar\fR Buf; Count:LongInt); \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the Stream is open and the stream status is \fBstOK\fR then \fBRead\fR will read \fBCount\fR bytes from the stream and place them in \fBBuf\fR.

\fBRead\fR will first try to read the data from the stream's internal buffer. If insufficient data is available, the buffer will be filled before contiunuing to read. This process is repeated until all needed data has been read.

For an example, see \fBTStream.Read\fR.


.SH ERRORS
In case of an error, \fBStatus\fR is set to \fBStReadError\fR, and \fBErrorInfo\fR gets the OS specific error, or 0 when an attempt was made to read beyond the end of the stream.
