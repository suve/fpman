.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBBaseUnix\fR, file \fBbunxh.inc\fR, line 107
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFpmmap\fR(start:pointer; len:size_t; prot:cint; flags:cint; fd:cint; offst:off_t):pointer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFpMMap\fR maps or unmaps files or devices into memory. The different arguments determine what and how the file is mapped:

.TP
.B adr
Address where to mmap the device. This address is a hint, and may not be followed.
.TP
.B len
Size (in bytes) of area to be mapped.
.TP
.B prot
Protection of mapped memory. This is a OR-ed combination of the following constants:
PROT_EXEC
The memory can be executed.
.TP
.B PROT_READ
The memory can be read.
.TP
.B PROT_WRITE
The memory can be written.
.TP
.B PROT_NONE
The memory can not be accessed.

.SH ERRORS
On error, -1 is returned and extended error information is returned by the \fBFpGetErrno\fR function.

.TP
.B Sys_EBADF
\fBfd\fR is not a valid file descriptor and \fBMAP_ANONYMOUS\fR was not specified.
.TP
.B Sys_EACCES
\fBMAP_PRIVATE\fR was specified, but \fBfd\fR is not open for reading. Or \fBMAP_SHARED\fR was asked and \fBPROT_WRITE\fR is set, fd is not open for writing
.TP
.B Sys_EINVAL
One of the record fields \fBStart\fR, \fBlength\fR or \fBoffset\fR is invalid.
.TP
.B Sys_ETXTBUSY
\fBMAP_DENYWRITE\fR was set but the object specified by fd is open for writing.
.TP
.B Sys_EAGAIN
\fBfd\fR is locked, or too much memory is locked.
.TP
