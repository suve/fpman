.SH LOCATION

.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFpGetRLimit\fR(resource:cint; rlim:PRLimit):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFpGetRLimit\fR gets the resource limits for the current process: \fBresource\fR determines the resource of which the kernel should return the limits (one of the many \fBRLIMIT_*\fR constants). \fBrlim\fR should point to a \fBTRLimit\fR record and on success will contain the resource limits.

The function returns zero if the resource limits were correctly returned.


.SH ERRORS
On error, -1 is returned and \fBfpgeterrno\fR can be used to retrieve the error code.
