.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBBaseUnix\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBFpRename\fR(old:PChar; newpath:PChar):cint;

function \fBFpRename\fR(old:AnsiString; newpath:AnsiString):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFpRename\fR renames the file \fBOld\fR to \fBNewPath\fR. \fBNewPath\fR can be in a different directory than \fBOld\fR, but it cannot be on another partition (device). Any existing file on the new location will be replaced.

If the operation fails, then the \fBOld\fR file will be preserved.

The function returns zero on succes, a nonzero value indicates failure.

Note: There exist a portable alterative to fpRename: system.rename. Please use fpRename only if you are writing Unix specific code. System.rename will work on all operating systems.
