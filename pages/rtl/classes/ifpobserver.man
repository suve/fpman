.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIFPObserver\fR is the interface an object must implement if it wishes to receive change notifications from another object. The presence of this interface will be checked when the object registers itself using IFPObserver.FPOAttachObserver. The change notifications arrive because the FPOObservedChanged method is called by the observed object.
