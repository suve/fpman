.SH NAME
TStream.ReadBuffer - Reads data from the stream to a buffer
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 849
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTStream.ReadBuffer\fR(\fBvar\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReadBuffer\fR reads \fBCount\fR bytes of the stream into \fBBuffer\fR. If the stream does not contain \fBCount\fR bytes, then an exception is raised.

\fBReadBuffer\fR should be used to read in a fixed number of bytes, such as when reading structures or the content of variables. If the number of bytes is not determined, use \fBTStream.Read\fR instead. \fBReadBuffer\fR uses \fBRead\fR internally to do the actual reading.


.SH ERRORS
If the stream does not allow to read \fBCount\fR bytes, then an exception is raised.
