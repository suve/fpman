.SH NAME
TStrings.Move - Move a string from one place in the list to another.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 675
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTStrings.Move\fR(CurIndex:Integer; NewIndex:Integer); \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMove\fR moves the string at position \fBCurIndex\fR so it has position \fBNewIndex\fR after the move operation. The object associated to the string is also moved. \fBCurIndex\fR and \fBNewIndex\fR should be in the range of \fB0\fR to \fBCount-1\fR.

\fIRemark:\fR \fBNewIndex\fR is \fInot\fR the position in the stringlist before the move operation starts. The move operation 
removes the string from position \fBCurIndex\fR 
inserts the string at position \fBNewIndex\fR This may not lead to the desired result if \fBNewIndex\fR is bigger than \fBCurIndex\fR. Consider the following example: \fBWith\fR MyStrings \fBdo\fR
 \fBbegin\fR
 Clear;
 Add('String 0');
 Add('String 1');
 Add('String 2');
 Add('String 3');
 Add('String 4');
 Move(1,3);
 \fBend\fR;
After the \fBMove\fR operation has completed, 'String 1' will be between 'String 3' and 'String 4'. 


.SH ERRORS
If either \fBCurIndex\fR or \fBNewIndex\fR is outside the allowed range, an \fBEStringListError\fR is raised.
