.SH NAME
TStrings.DelimitedText - Get or set all strings in the list in a delimited form.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 683
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property  \fBTStrings.DelimitedText\fR:string \\fBread \\fRGetDelimitedText \\fBwrite \\fRSetDelimitedText;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDelimitedText\fR returns all strings, properly quoted with \fBQuoteChar\fR and separated by the \fBDelimiter\fR character.

Strings are quoted if they contain a space or any character with ASCII value less than 32.

The \fBCommaText\fR property is a special case of delimited text where the delimiter character is a comma and the quote character is a double quote.

If \fBStrictDelimiter\fR is set to \fBTrue\fR, then no quoting is done (The \fBQuoteChar\fR property is disregarded completely): the returned text will contain the items in the stringlist, separated by the \fBDelimiter\fR character. When writing the \fBDelimitedText\fR property, the text will be split at all occurrences of the \fBDelimiter\fR character; however, when reading, the \fBQuoteChar\fR property will be taken into account.
