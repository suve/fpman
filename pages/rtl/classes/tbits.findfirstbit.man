.SH NAME
TBits.FindFirstBit - Find first bit with a particular value
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 415
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTBits.FindFirstBit\fR(State:Boolean):LongInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFindFirstBit\fR searches for the first bit with value \fBState\fR. It returns the position of this bit, or \fB-1\fR if no such bit was found.

The search starts at position 0 in the array. If the first search returned a positive result, the found position is saved, and the \fBFindNextBit\fR and \fBFindPrevBit\fR will use this position to resume the search. To start a search from a certain position, the start position can be set with the \fBSetIndex\fR instead.


.SH ERRORS
None.
