.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTStringStream.Read\fR(\fBvar\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt):LongInt; \fBoverride\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRead\fR overrides the \fBRead\fR from \fBTStream\fR. It tries to read \fBCount\fR bytes into \fBBuffer\fR. It returns the number of bytes actually read. The position of the stream is advanced with the number of bytes actually read; When the reading has reached the end of the \fBDataString\fR, then the reading stops, i.e. it is not possible to read beyond the end of the datastring.
