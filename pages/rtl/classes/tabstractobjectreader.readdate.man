.SH NAME
TAbstractObjectReader.ReadDate - Read a date value from the stream.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 1115
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTAbstractObjectReader.ReadDate\fR:TDateTime; \fBvirtual\fR; \fBabstract\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReadDate\fR is called by the streaming system when it wants to read a date/time value from the stream (i.e. after \fBReadValue\fR returned a valuetype of \fBvaDate\fR). The return value should be the date/time value. (This value can be stored as a float, since \fBTDateTime\fR is nothing but a float.)
