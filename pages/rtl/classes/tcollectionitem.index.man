.SH NAME
TCollectionItem.Index - Index of the item in its managing collection TCollection.Items property.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 503
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property  \fBTCollectionItem.Index\fR:Integer \\fBread \\fRGetIndex \\fBwrite \\fRSetIndex;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIndex\fR is the current index of the item in its managing collection's \fBTCollection.Items\fR property. This property may change as items are added and removed from the collection.

The index of an item is zero-based, i.e. the first item has index zero. The last item has index \fBCount-1\fR where \fBCount\fR is the number of items in the collection.

The \fBIndex\fR property of the items in a collection form a continuous series ranging from \fB0\fR to \fBCount-1\fR. The \fBTCollectionItem.ID\fR property does not form a continuous series, but can also be used to identify an item.
