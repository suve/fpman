.SH NAME
TStream.Read - Reads data from the stream to a buffer and returns the number of bytes read.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 845
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTStream.Read\fR(\fBvar\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt):LongInt; \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRead\fR attempts to read \fBCount\fR from the stream to \fBBuffer\fR and returns the number of bytes actually read.

This method should be used when the number of bytes is not determined. If a specific number of bytes is expected, use \fBTSTream.ReadBuffer\fR instead.

As implemented in \fBTStream\fR, \fBRead\fR does nothing but raises an \fBEStreamError\fR exception to indicate that reading is not supported. Descendent classes that allow reading must override this method to do the actual reading.


.SH ERRORS
In case a descendent class does not allow reading from the stream, an exception is raised.
