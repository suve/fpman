.SH NAME
TBits.XorBits - Performs a \fBxor\fR operation on the bits.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 408
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTBits.XorBits\fR(BitSet:TBits);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBXorBits\fR performs a \fBxor\fR operation on the bits in the array with the bits of array \fBBitSet\fR.

If \fBBitSet\fR contains less bits than the current array, then all bits which have no counterpart in \fBBitSet\fR are left untouched.

If the current array contains less bits than \fBBitSet\fR then it is grown to the size of \fBBitSet\fR before the \fBxor\fR operation is performed.


.SH ERRORS
None.
