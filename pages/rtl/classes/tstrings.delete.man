.SH NAME
TStrings.Delete - Delete a string from the list.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 660
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTStrings.Delete\fR(Index:Integer); \fBvirtual\fR; \fBabstract\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDelete\fR deletes the string at position \fBIndex\fR from the list. The associated object is also removed from the list, but not destroyed. \fBIndex\fR is zero-based, and should be in the range \fB0\fR to \fBCount-1\fR.

Since it is an abstract method, \fBTStrings\fR itself does not implement \fBDelete\fR. Descendent classes such as \fBTStringList\fR implement this method.


.SH ERRORS
If \fBIndex\fR is not in the allowed range, an \fBEStringListError\fR is raised.
