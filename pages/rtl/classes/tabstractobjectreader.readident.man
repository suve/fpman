package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 1118
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTAbstractObjectReader.ReadIdent\fR(ValueType:TValueType):string; \fBvirtual\fR; \fBabstract\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReadIdent\fR is called by the streaming system if it expects to read an identifier of type \fBValueType\fR from the stream after a call to \fBReadValue\fR returned \fBvaIdent\fR. The identifier should be returned as a string. Note that in some cases the identifier does not actually have to be in the stream. The following table indicates which identifiers must actually be read:
