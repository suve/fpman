.SH LOCATION

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtype\fR TFindMethodEvent = procedure(Reader:TReader; \fBconst\fR MethodName:string; \fBvar\fR Address:Pointer; \fBvar\fR Error:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a \fBTReader\fR instance needs to locate a method and it doesn't find it in the streamed form, then the \fBOnFindMethod\fR event handler will be called, if one is installed. This event can be assigned in order to use different locating methods. If a method is found, then its address should be returned in \fBAddress\fR. The \fBError\fR should be set to \fBTrue\fR if the reader should raise an exception after the event was handled. If it is set to \fBFalse\fR no exception will be raised, even if no method was found. On entry, \fBError\fR will be set to \fBTrue\fR.
