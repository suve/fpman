.SH NAME
TBasicAction.Update - Triggers the OnUpdate event
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 1812
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTBasicAction.Update\fR:Boolean; \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBUpdate\fR triggers the \fBOnUpdate\fR event, if one is assigned. It returns \fBTrue\fR if the event was triggered, or \fBFalse\fR if no event was assigned.

Application programmers should never run \fBUpdate\fR directly. The \fBUpdate\fR method is called automatically by the action mechanism; Normally this is in the Idle time of an application. An application programmer should assign the \fBOnUpdate\fR event, and perform any checks in that handler.


.SH SEE ALSO
