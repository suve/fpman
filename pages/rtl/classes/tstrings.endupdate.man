.SH NAME
TStrings.EndUpdate - Mark the end of an update batch.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 661
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTStrings.EndUpdate\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBEndUpdate\fR should be called at the end of a lengthy operation on the stringlist, but only if there was a call to \fBBeginUpdate\fR before the operation was started. It is best to put the call to \fBEndUpdate\fR in the context of a \fBFinally\fR block, so it will be called even if an exception occurs.

For more information, see \fBTStrings.BeginUpdate\fR.

\fBTStrings\fR implements the \fBIFPObserved\fR interface: when \fBEndUpdate\fR is called, a \fBooChanged\fR notification is sent to all observers.
