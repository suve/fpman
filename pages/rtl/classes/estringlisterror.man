\fB1.\fR There is not enough memory to expand the list.

\fB2.\fR The list tried to grow beyond its maximal capacity.

\fB3.\fR A non-existent element of the list was referenced. (i.e. the list index was out of bounds)

\fB4.\fR An attempt was made to add a duplicate entry to a TStringList when TStringList.Duplicates is \fBFalse\fR.
