.SH NAME
TStream.WriteBuffer - Writes data from a buffer to the stream
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 850
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTStream.WriteBuffer\fR(\fBconst\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWriteBuffer\fR writes \fBCount\fR bytes to the stream from \fBBuffer\fR. If the stream does not allow \fBCount\fR bytes to be written, then an exception is raised.

\fBWriteBuffer\fR should be used to write a fixed number of bytes, such as when writing structures or the content of variables. If the number of bytes is not determined, use \fBTStream.Write\fR instead. \fBWriteBuffer\fR uses \fBWrite\fR internally to do the actual writing.


.SH ERRORS
If the stream does not allow to write \fBCount\fR bytes, then an exception is raised.
