.SH NAME
TStream.Seek - Sets the current position in the stream
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTStream.Seek\fR(Offset:LongInt; Origin:Word):LongInt; \fBvirtual\fR;

function \fBTStream.Seek\fR(\fBconst\fR Offset:Int64; Origin:TSeekOrigin):Int64; \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSeek\fR sets the position of the stream to \fBOffset\fR bytes from \fBOrigin\fR. There is a 32-bit variant of this function and a 64-bit variant. The difference can be made by choosing the correct \fBOffset\fR parameter: the integer-typed parameter selects the 32-bit variant, the parameter of type \fBTSeekOrigin\fR selects the 64-bit variant of the function.

The \fBOrigin\fR parameter for the 32-bit version can have one of the following values:

.TS

l | l 
l | l 
l | l 
l | l.
Constant	Meaning	
_
soFromBeginning	Set the position relative to the start of the stream.	
_
soFromCurrent	Set the position relative to the current position in the stream.	
_
soFromEnd	Set the position relative to the end of the stream.	
.TE

These values are defined in the \fBSysUtils\fR unit.

The \fBOrigin\fR parameter for the 64-bit version has one of the following values:

.TS

l | l 
l | l 
l | l 
l | l.
Value	Meaning	
_
soBeginning	Offset is interpreted relative to the start of the stream.	
_
soCurrent	Offset is interpreted relative to the current position in the stream.	
_
soEnd	Offset is interpreted relative to the end of the stream.	
.TE

\fBOffset\fR should be negative when the origin is \fBSoFromEnd\fR (\fBsoEnd\fR). It should be positive for \fBsoFromBeginning\fR and can have both signs for \fBsoFromCurrent\fR 

This is an abstract method, which must be overridden by descendent classes. They may choose not to implement this method for all values of \fBOrigin\fR and \fBOffset\fR.

\fIRemark:\fR Internally, all calls are re-routed to the 64-bit version of the call. When creating a descendent of \fBTStream\fR, the 64-bit version of the call should be overridden.


.SH ERRORS
An exception may be raised if this method is called with an invalid pair of \fBOffset\fR,\fBOrigin\fR values. e.g. a negative \fBoffset\fR for \fBsoFromBeginning\fR (or \fBsoBeginning\fR).
