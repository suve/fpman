.SH NAME
TFileStream.Destroy - Destroys the file stream.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBClasses\fR, file \fBclassesh.inc\fR, line 930
.SH SYNOPSIS
public destructor \fBTFileStream.Destroy\fR; \fBoverride\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDestroy\fR closes the file (causing possible buffered data to be written to disk) and then calls the inherited destructor.

Do not call \fBdestroy\fR directly, instead call the \fBFree\fR method. Destroy does not check whether \fBSelf\fR is nil, while \fBFree\fR does.
