.SH NAME
SymLink - Create a symbolic link
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBoldlinux\fR, file \fBoldlinux.pp\fR, line 1390
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBSymLink\fR(OldPath:PathStr; NewPath:PathStr):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSymLink\fR makes \fBNewpath\fR point to the file in \fBOldPath\fR, which doesn't necessarily exist. The two files DO NOT have the same inode number. This is known as a 'soft' link.

The permissions of the link are irrelevant, as they are not used when following the link. Ownership of the file is only checked in case of removal or renaming of the link.

The function returns \fBTrue\fR if the call was succesfull, \fBFalse\fR if the call failed.
