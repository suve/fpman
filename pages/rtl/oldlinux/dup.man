.SH NAME
Dup - Duplicate a file handle
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBoldlinux\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBDup\fR(oldfile:LongInt; \fBvar\fR newfile:LongInt):Boolean;

function \fBDup\fR(\fBvar\fR oldfile:text; \fBvar\fR newfile:text):Boolean;

function \fBDup\fR(\fBvar\fR oldfile:file; \fBvar\fR newfile:file):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Makes \fBNewFile\fR an exact copy of \fBOldFile\fR, after having flushed the buffer of \fBOldFile\fR in case it is a Text file or untyped file. Due to the buffering mechanism of Pascal, this has not the same functionality as the dup call in C. The internal Pascal buffers are not the same after this call, but when the buffers are flushed (e.g. after output), the output is sent to the same file. Doing an lseek will, however, work as in C, i.e. doing a lseek will change the fileposition in both files.

The function returns \fBFalse\fR in case of an error, \fBTrue\fR if successful.


.SH ERRORS
In case of errors, \fBLinuxerror\fR is used to report errors.

.TP
.B sys_ebadf
\fBOldFile\fR hasn't been assigned.
