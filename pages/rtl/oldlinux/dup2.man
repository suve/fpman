.SH NAME
Dup2 - Duplicate one filehandle to another
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBoldlinux\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBDup2\fR(oldfile:LongInt; newfile:LongInt):Boolean;

function \fBDup2\fR(\fBvar\fR oldfile:text; \fBvar\fR newfile:text):Boolean;

function \fBDup2\fR(\fBvar\fR oldfile:file; \fBvar\fR newfile:file):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Makes \fBNewFile\fR an exact copy of \fBOldFile\fR, after having flushed the buffer of \fBOldFile\fR in the case of text or untyped files.

\fBNewFile\fR can be an assigned file. If \fBnewfile\fR was open, it is closed first. Due to the buffering mechanism of Pascal, this has not the same functionality as the \fBdup2\fR call in C. The internal Pascal buffers are not the same after this call, but when the buffers are flushed (e.g. after output), the output is sent to the same file. Doing an lseek will, however, work as in C, i.e. doing a lseek will change the fileposition in both files.

The function returns \fBTrue\fR if succesful, false otherwise.


.SH ERRORS
In case of error, \fBLinuxerror\fR is used to report errors.

.TP
.B sys_ebadf
\fBOldFile\fR hasn't been assigned.
