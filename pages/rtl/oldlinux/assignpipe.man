.SH NAME
AssignPipe - Create a set of pipe file handlers
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBoldlinux\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBAssignPipe\fR(\fBvar\fR pipe_in:LongInt; \fBvar\fR pipe_out:LongInt):Boolean;

function \fBAssignPipe\fR(\fBvar\fR pipe_in:text; \fBvar\fR pipe_out:text):Boolean;

function \fBAssignPipe\fR(\fBvar\fR pipe_in:file; \fBvar\fR pipe_out:file):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAssignePipe\fR creates a pipe, i.e. two file objects, one for input, one for output. What is written to \fBPipe_out\fR, can be read from \fBPipe_in\fR.

This call is overloaded. The in and out pipe can take three forms: an typed or untyped file, a text file or a file descriptor.

If a text file is passed then reading and writing from/to the pipe can be done through the usual \fBReadln(Pipe_in,...)\fR and \fBWriteln(Pipe_out,...)\fR procedures.

The function returns \fBTrue\fR if everything went succesfully, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.


.SH ERRORS
In case the function fails and returns \fBFalse\fR, \fBLinuxError\fR is used to report errors:

.TP
.B sys_emfile
Too many file descriptors for this process.
.TP
.B sys_enfile
The system file table is full.

.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B POpen
Pipe file to standard input/output of program
.TP
.B MkFifo
Create FIFO (named pipe) in file system
