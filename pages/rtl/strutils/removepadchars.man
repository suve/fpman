.SH NAME
RemovePadChars - Remove any trailing or leading characters in a set from a string
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBstrutils\fR, file \fBstrutils.pp\fR, line 205
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBRemovePadChars\fR(\fBvar\fR S:AnsiString; \fBconst\fR CSet:TSysCharSet);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRemovePadChars\fR removes any leading trailing characters from \fBS\fR that appear in the set \fBCSet\fR, i.e. it starts with the last character and works its way to the start of the string, and it stops removing characters as soon as a character not in \fBCSet\fR is encountered. Then the same procedure is repeated starting from the beginning of the string. This is similar in behaviour to \fBTrim\fR which used whitespace as the set.


.SH ERRORS
None.
