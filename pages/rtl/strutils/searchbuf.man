function \fBSearchBuf\fR(Buf:PChar; BufLen:Integer; SelStart:Integer; SelLength:Integer; SearchString:string):PChar;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSearchBuf\fR searches the buffer \fBBuf\fR for the occurrence of \fBSearchString\fR. At must \fBBuflen\fR characters are searched, and the search is started at \fBSelStart\fR +\fBSelLength\fR. If a match is found, a pointer to the position of the match is returned. The parameter \fBOptions\fR specifies how the search is conducted. It is a set of the following options:

.TS
ci | ci 
l | l 
l | l 
l | l.
Option	Effect	
=
soDown	Searches forward, starting at the end of the selection. Default is searching up	
_
soMatchCase	Observe case when searching. Default is to ignore case.	
_
soWholeWord	Match only whole words. Default also returns parts of words	
.TE

The standard constant \fBWordDelimiters\fR is used to mark the boundaries of words.

The \fBSelStart\fR parameter is zero based.


.SH ERRORS
Buflen must be the real length of the string, no checking on this is performed.
