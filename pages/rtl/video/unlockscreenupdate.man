.SH NAME
UnlockScreenUpdate - Unlock screen update.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBvideo\fR, file \fBvideoh.inc\fR, line 117
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBUnlockScreenUpdate\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBUnlockScreenUpdate\fR decrements the screen update lock count with one if it is larger than zero. When the lock count reaches zero, the \fBUpdateScreen\fR will actually update the screen. No screen update will be performed as long as the screen update lock count is nonzero. This mechanism can be used to increase screen performance in case a lot of writing is done.

It is important to make sure that each call to \fBLockScreenUpdate\fR is matched by exactly one call to \fBUnlockScreenUpdate\fR 

For an example, see \fBGetLockScreenCount\fR.


.SH ERRORS
None.
