.SH NAME
LockScreenUpdate - Prevent further screen updates.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBvideo\fR, file \fBvideoh.inc\fR, line 115
.SH SYNOPSIS
procedure \fBLockScreenUpdate\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLockScreenUpdate\fR increments the screen update lock count with one. As long as the screen update lock count is not zero, \fBUpdateScreen\fR will not actually update the screen.

This function can be used to optimize screen updating: If a lot of writing on the screen needs to be done (by possibly unknown functions), calling \fBLockScreenUpdate\fR before the drawing, and \fBUnlockScreenUpdate\fR after the drawing, followed by a \fBUpdateScreen\fR call, all writing will be shown on screen at once.

For an example, see \fBGetLockScreenCount\fR.


.SH ERRORS
