.SH NAME
shmget - Return the ID of a shared memory block, possibly creating it
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBipc\fR, file \fBipc.pp\fR, line 267
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBshmget\fR(key:TKey; size:size_t; flag:cint):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshmget\fR returns the ID of a shared memory block, described by \fBkey\fR. Depending on the flags in \fBflag\fR, a new memory block is created.

\fBflag\fR can have one or more of the following values (combined by ORs):

.TP
.B IPC_CREAT
The queue is created if it doesn't already exist.
.TP
.B IPC_EXCL
If used in combination with \fBIPC_CREAT\fR, causes the call to fail if the queue already exists. It cannot be used by itself.
.TP 0
Optionally, the flags can be \fBOR\fR ed with a permission mode, which is the same mode that can be used in the file system.

if a new memory block is created, then it will have size \fBSize\fR bytes in it.


.SH ERRORS
On error, -1 is returned, and \fBIPCError\fR is set.
