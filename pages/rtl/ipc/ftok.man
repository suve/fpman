.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBipc\fR, file \fBipc.pp\fR, line 149
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBftok\fR(Path:PChar; ID:cint):TKey;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBftok\fR returns a key that can be used in a \fBsemget\fR\fBshmget\fR or \fBmsgget\fR call to access a new or existing IPC resource.

\fBPath\fR is the name of a file in the file system, \fBID\fR is a character of your choice. The ftok call does the same as it's C couterpart, so a pascal program and a C program will access the same resource if they use the same \fBPath\fR and \fBID\fR 

For an example, see \fBmsgctl\fR, \fBsemctl\fR or \fBshmctl\fR.


.SH ERRORS
\fBftok\fR returns -1 if the file in \fBPath\fR doesn't exist.
