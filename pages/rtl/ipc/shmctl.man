.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBshmctl\fR(shmid:cint; cmd:cint; buf:PShmid_DS):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshmctl\fR performs various operations on the shared memory block identified by identifier \fBshmid\fR.

The \fBbuf\fR parameter points to a \fBTSHMid_ds\fR record. The \fBcmd\fR parameter is used to pass which operation is to be performed. It can have one of the following values :

.TP
.B IPC_STAT
\fBshmctl\fR fills the \fBTSHMid_ds\fR record that \fBbuf\fR points to with the available information about the shared memory block.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
applies the values in the \fBipc_perm\fR record that \fBbuf\fR points to, to the shared memory block.
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
the shared memory block is destroyed (after all processes to which the block is attached, have detached from it).
.TP 0
If successful, the function returns \fBTrue\fR, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.


.SH ERRORS
If an error occurs, the function returns \fBFalse\fR, and \fBIPCerror\fR is set.
