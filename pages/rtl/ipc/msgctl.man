.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBmsgctl\fR(msqid:cint; cmd:cint; buf:PMSQid_ds):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmsgctl\fR performs various operations on the message queue with id \fBID\fR. Which operation is performed, depends on the \fBcmd\fR parameter, which can have one of the following values:

.TP
.B IPC_STAT
In this case, the \fBmsgctl\fR call fills the \fBTMSQid_ds\fR structure with information about the message queue.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
in this case, the \fBmsgctl\fR call sets the permissions of the queue as specified in the \fBipc_perm\fR record inside \fBbuf\fR.
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
If this is specified, the message queue will be removed from the system.
.TP 0
\fBbuf\fR contains the data that are needed by the call. It can be \fBNil\fR in case the message queue should be removed.

The function returns \fBTrue\fR if successfull, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.


.SH ERRORS
On error, \fBFalse\fR is returned, and \fBIPCerror\fR is set accordingly.
