.SH NAME
ReadKey - Read key from keybuffer
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBCrt\fR, file \fBcrth.inc\fR, line 76
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBReadKey\fR:Char;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReadKey\fR reads 1 key from the keyboard buffer, and returns this. If an extended or function key has been pressed, then the zero ASCII code is returned. You can then read the scan code of the key with a second ReadKey call.

Key mappings under Linux can cause the wrong key to be reported by \fBReadKey\fR, so caution is needed when using \fBReadKey\fR.


.SH ERRORS
None.


.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B KeyPressed
Check if there is a keypress in the keybuffer
