.SH NAME
WithinPastMilliSeconds - Check whether two datetimes are only a number of milliseconds apart
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBdateutils\fR, file \fBdateutil.inc\fR, line 250
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBWithinPastMilliSeconds\fR(\fBconst\fR ANow:TDateTime; \fBconst\fR AThen:TDateTime; \fBconst\fR AMilliSeconds:Int64):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWithinPastMilliSeconds\fR compares the timestamps \fBANow\fR and \fBAThen\fR and returns \fBTrue\fR if the difference between them is at most \fBAMilliSeconds\fR milliseconds apart, or \fBFalse\fR if they are further apart.

\fIRemark:\fR Since this function uses the MilliSecondsBetween function to calculate the difference in milliseconds, this means that fractional milliseconds do not count, and the fractional part is simply dropped, so for two dates actually 2 and a half milliseconds apart, the result will also be \fBTrue\fR
