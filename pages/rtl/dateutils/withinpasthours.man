.SH NAME
WithinPastHours - Check whether two datetimes are only a number of hours apart
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBdateutils\fR, file \fBdateutil.inc\fR, line 247
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBWithinPastHours\fR(\fBconst\fR ANow:TDateTime; \fBconst\fR AThen:TDateTime; \fBconst\fR AHours:Int64):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWithinPastHours\fR compares the timestamps \fBANow\fR and \fBAThen\fR and returns \fBTrue\fR if the difference between them is at most \fBAHours\fR hours apart, or \fBFalse\fR if they are further apart.

\fIRemark:\fR Since this function uses the HoursBetween function to calculate the difference in Hours, this means that fractional hours do not count, and the fractional part is simply dropped, so for two dates actually 2 and a half hours apart, the result will also be \fBTrue\fR
