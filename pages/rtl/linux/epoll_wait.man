.SH LOCATION

.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBepoll_wait\fR(epfd:cint; events:PEpoll_Event; maxevents:cint; timeout:cint):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBepoll_wait\fR waits for \fBtimeout\fR milliseconds for an event to occur on epoll file descriptor \fBepfd\fR. If \fBtimeout\fR is -1, it waits indefinitely, if \fBtimeour\fR is zero, it does not wait, but returns immediatly, even if no events were detected.

On return, data for at most \fBmaxevents\fR will be returned in the memory pointed to by \fBevents\fR. The function returns the number of file descriptors for which events were reported. This can be zero if the timeout was reached.


.SH ERRORS
On error -1 is returned, and errno is set accordingly.
