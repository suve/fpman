.SH NAME
epoll_create - Create new epoll file descriptor
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBLinux\fR, file \fBlinux.pp\fR, line 268
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBepoll_create\fR(size:cint):cint;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBepoll_create\fR creates a new epoll file descriptor. The \fBsize\fR argument indicates to the kernel approximately how many structures should be allocated, but is by no means an upper limit.

On success, a file descriptor is returned that can be used in subsequent \fBepoll_ctl\fR or \fBepoll_wait\fR calls, and should be closed using the \fBfpClose\fR call.


.SH ERRORS
On error, -1 is returned, and \fBerrno\fR is set.

.B epoll_ctl
