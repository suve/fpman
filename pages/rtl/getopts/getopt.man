.SH NAME
GetOpt - Get next short option.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBgetopts\fR, file \fBgetopts.pp\fR, line 45
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBGetOpt\fR(ShortOpts:string):Char;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns the next option found on the command-line. If no more options are found, returns \fBEndOfOptions\fR. If the option requires an argument, it is returned in the \fBOptArg\fR variable.

\fBShortOptions\fR is a string containing all possible one-letter options. If a letter is followed by a colon (:), then that option needs an argument. If a letter is followed by 2 colons, the option has an optional argument. If the first character of \fBshortoptions\fR is a \fB'+'\fR then options following a non-option are regarded as non-options (standard Unix behavior). If it is a \fB'-'\fR, then all non-options are treated as arguments of a option with character \fB#0\fR. This is useful for applications that require their options in the exact order as they appear on the command-line. If the first character of \fBshortoptions\fR is none of the above, options and non-options are permuted, so all non-options are behind all options. This allows options and non-options to be in random order on the command line.


.SH ERRORS
Errors are reported through giving back a \fB'?'\fR character. \fBOptOpt\fR then gives the character which caused the error. If \fBOptErr\fR is \fBTrue\fR then getopt prints an error-message to \fBstdout\fR.
