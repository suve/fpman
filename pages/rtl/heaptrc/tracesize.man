.SH NAME
tracesize - Specify size of callback trace
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBheaptrc\fR, file \fBheaptrc.pp\fR, line 58
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconst\fR tracesize = 8;

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTracesize\fR specifies how many levels of calls are displayed of the call stack during the memory dump. If you specify \fBkeepreleased:=True\fR then half the \fBTraceSize\fR is reserved for the \fBGetMem\fR call stack, and the other half is reserved for the \fBFreeMem\fR call stack. For example, the default value of 8 will cause eight levels of call frames to be dumped for the getmem call if \fBkeepreleased\fR is \fBFalse\fR. If \fBKeepReleased\fR is true, then 4 levels of call frames will be dumped for the \fBGetMem\fR call and 4 frames wil be dumped for the \fBFreeMem\fR call. If you want to change this value, you must recode the \fBheaptrc\fR unit.
