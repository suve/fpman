.SH NAME
keepreleased - Keep released blocks in memory
.SH LOCATION
package \fBrtl\fR, unit \fBheaptrc\fR, file \fBheaptrc.pp\fR, line 74
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconst\fR keepreleased: \fBBoolean\fR = False;

.SH DESCRIPTION
If \fBkeepreleased\fR is set to true, then a list of freed memory blocks is kept. This is useful if you suspect that the same memory block is released twice. However, this option is very memory intensive, so use it sparingly, and only when it's really necessary.
