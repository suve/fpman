.SH NAME
TIDEAStream - Ancestor stream for IDEA encryption/decryption streams.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBidea\fR, file \fBidea.pp\fR, line 76
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtype\fR TIDEAStream = \fBclass (TOwnerStream)\fR
.br
\fBpublic\fR
  \fBconstructor\fR Create; \fBoverload\fR; // Creates a new instance of the \fBTIDEAStream\fR class
  \fBproperty\fR Key: \fBTIDEAKey\fR; [r]   // Key used when encrypting/decrypting
.br
\fBend\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Do not create instances of \fBTIDEAStream\fR directly. It implements no useful functionality: it serves as a common ancestor of the \fBTIDEAEncryptStream\fR and \fBTIDEADeCryptStream\fR, and simply provides some fields that these descendent classes use when encrypting/decrypting. One of these classes should be created, depending on whether one wishes to encrypt or to decrypt.


.SH SEE ALSO
