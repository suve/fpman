TASCII85EncoderStream.Create - Create a new instance of \fBTASCII85EncoderStream\fR 
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBascii85\fR, file \fBascii85.pp\fR, line 88
.SH SYNOPSIS
public constructor \fBTASCII85EncoderStream.Create\fR(ADest:TStream; AWidth:Integer; ABoundary:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreate\fR creates a new instance of\fBTASCII85EncoderStream\fR. It stores \fBADest\fR as the destination stream for the encoded data. The \fBWidth\fR parameter indicates the width of the lines that are written by the encoder: after this amount of characters, a linefeed is put in the data stream. If \fBABoundary\fR is \fBTrue\fR then a boundary delineator is written to the stream before and after the data.
