.SH NAME
TCustomIniFile.UpdateFile - Update the file on disk
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBIniFiles\fR, file \fBinifiles.pp\fR, line 155
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTCustomIniFile.UpdateFile\fR; \fBvirtual\fR; \fBabstract\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBUpdateFile\fR writes the in-memory image of the ini-file to disk. To speed up operation of the inifile class, the whole ini-file is read into memory when the class is created, and all operations are performed in-memory. If \fBCacheUpdates\fR is set to \fBTrue\fR, any changes to the inifile are only in memory, until they are committed to disk with a call to \fBUpdateFile\fR. If \fBCacheUpdates\fR is set to \fBFalse\fR, then all operations which cause a change in the.ini file will immediatly be committed to disk with a call to \fBUpdateFile\fR. Since the whole file is written to disk, this may have serious impact on performance.
