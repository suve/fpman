.SH NAME
TIniFile.UpdateFile - Update the file on disk
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBIniFiles\fR, file \fBinifiles.pp\fR, line 189
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTIniFile.UpdateFile\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBUpdateFile\fR writes the in-memory data for the ini file to disk. The whole file is written. If the ini file was instantiated from a stream, then the stream is updated. Note that the stream must be seekable for this to work correctly. The ini file is marked as 'clean' after a call to \fBUpdateFile\fR (i.e. not in need of writing to disk).


.SH ERRORS
If an error occurs when writing to stream or disk, an exception may be raised.


.SH SEE ALSO

Should changes be kept in memory
