.SH NAME
TAVLTree.SetNodeManager - Set the node instance manager to use
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBAVL_Tree\fR, file \fBavl_tree.pp\fR, line 110
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTAVLTree.SetNodeManager\fR(NewMgr:TBaseAVLTreeNodeManager; AutoFree:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSetNodeManager\fR sets the node manager instance used by the tree to \fBnewmgr\fR. It should be called before any nodes are added to the tree. The \fBTAVLTree\fR instance will not destroy the nodemanager, thus the same instance of the tree node manager can be used to manager the nodes of multiple \fBTAVLTree\fR instances.

By default, a single instance of \fBTAVLTreeNodeMemManager\fR is used to manage the nodes of all \fBTAVLTree\fR instances.
