.SH NAME
debugservers - Writing a debug server
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdbugintf\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Writing a debug server is relatively easy. It should instantiate a \fBTSimpleIPCServer\fR class from the \fBSimpleIPC\fR unit, and use the \fBDebugServerID\fR as \fBServerID\fR identification. This constant, as well as the record containing the message which is sent between client and server is defined in the \fBmsgintf\fR unit.

The \fBdbugintf\fR unit relies on the \fBSimpleIPC\fR mechanism to communicate with the debug server, hence it works on all platforms that have a functional version of that unit. It also uses \fBTProcess\fR to start the debug server if needed, so the \fBprocess\fR unit should also be functional.
