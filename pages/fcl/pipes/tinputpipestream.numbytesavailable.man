.SH NAME
TInputPipeStream.NumBytesAvailable - Number of bytes available for reading.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBPipes\fR, file \fBpipes.pp\fR, line 43
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTInputPipeStream.NumBytesAvailable\fR: DWord
  \fBread\fR GetNumBytesAvailable;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBNumBytesAvailable\fR is the number of bytes available for reading. This is the number of bytes in the OS buffer for the pipe. It is not a number of bytes in an internal buffer.

If this number is nonzero, then reading \fBNumBytesAvailable\fR bytes from the stream will not block the process. Reading more than \fBNumBytesAvailable\fR bytes will block the process, while it waits for the requested number of bytes to become available.


.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B TInputPipeStream.Read
Read data from the stream to a buffer.
