.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTCache.SlotCount\fR: Integer
  \fBread\fR FSlotCount
  \fBwrite\fR SetSlotCount;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSlotCount\fR is the number of slots in the list. Its initial value is set when the \fBTCache\fR instance is created, but this can be changed at any time. If items are added to the list and the list is full, then the number of slots is not increased, but the least used item is dropped from the list. In that case \fBOnFreeSlot\fR is called.
