.SH NAME
TOnIsDataEqual - Callback type to check whether 2 data types are equal.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBCacheCls\fR, file \fBcachecls.pp\fR, line 54
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtype\fR TOnIsDataEqual = function(ACache:TCache; AData1:Pointer; AData2:Pointer):Boolean \\fBof object\\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTOnIsDataEqual\fR is a callback prototype; It is used by the \fBTCache.Add\fR call to determine whether the item to be added is a new item or not. The function returns \fBTrue\fR if the 2 data pointers \fBAData1\fR and \fBAData2\fR should be considered equal, or \fBFalse\fR when they are not.

For most purposes, comparing the pointers will be enough, but if the pointers are ansistrings, then the contents should be compared.
