.SH NAME
TJSONNumberType - Enumerate the different kind of numerical types
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBfpjson\fR, file \fBfpjson.pp\fR, line 115
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtype\fR TJSONNumberType = \fB(\fR
  ntFloat,   // Floating point value
  ntInteger, // 32-bit Integer value
  ntInt64    // 64-bit integer value
.br
\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTJSONNumberType\fR is used to enumerate the different kind of numerical types: JSON only has a single 'number' format. Depending on how the value was parsed, FPC tries to create a value that is as close to the original value as possible: this can be one of integer, int64 or TJSONFloatType (normally a double). The number types have a common ancestor, and they are distinguished by their \fBTJSONNumber.NumberType\fR value.
