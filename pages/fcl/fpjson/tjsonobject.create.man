.SH NAME
TJSONObject.Create - Create a new instance of JSON object data.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBfpjson\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
public constructor \fBTJSONObject.Create\fR;\fBconst\fR Elements: \fB\fBarray\fR \fBof\fR \fBConst\fR


\fR;

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreate\fR creates a new JSON object instance, and initializes the data with \fBElements\fR. Elements is an array containing an even number of items, alternating a name and a value. The names must be strings, and the values are converted to various \fBTJSONData\fR instances. If a value is an instance of \fBTJSONData\fR, it is added to the object array as-is.

The data type of the inserted objects is determined from the type of data passed to it, with a natural mapping. A \fBNil\fR pointer will be inserted as a \fBTJSONNull\fR value. The following gives an example:


.SH ERRORS
An \fBEConvertError\fR exception is raised in one of the following cases:


\fB1.\fR If an odd number of arguments is passed

\fB2.\fR an item where a name is expected does not contain a string

\fB3.\fR A value contains an invalid class

\fB4.\fR A value of a not recognized data type (pointer) is inserted in the elements
