.SH NAME
TBlowFishEncryptStream.Write - Write data to the stream
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBBlowFish\fR, file \fBblowfish.pp\fR, line 71
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTBlowFishEncryptStream.Write\fR(\fBconst\fR Buffer; Count:LongInt):LongInt;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWrite\fR will encrypt and write \fBCount\fR bytes from \fBBuffer\fR to the destination stream. The function returns the actual number of bytes written. The data is not encrypted in-place, but placed in a special buffer for encryption.

Data is always written 4 bytes at a time, since this is the amount of bytes required by the Blowfish algorithm. If no multiple of 4 was written to the destination stream, the \fBFlush\fR mechanism can be used to write the remaining bytes.
