.SH NAME
TBlowFishDeCryptStream.Seek - Set the stream position.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBBlowFish\fR, file \fBblowfish.pp\fR, line 79
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTBlowFishDeCryptStream.Seek\fR(\fBconst\fR Offset:Int64; Origin:TSeekOrigin):Int64; \fBoverride\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSeek\fR emulates a forward seek by reading and discarding data. The discarded data is lost. Since it is a forward seek, this means that only \fBsoFromCurrent\fR can be specified for \fBOrigin\fR with a positive (or zero) \fBOffset\fR value. All other values will result in an exception. The function returns the new position in the stream.


.SH ERRORS
If any other combination of \fBOffset\fR and \fBOrigin\fR than the allowed combination is specified, then an \fBEBlowFishError\fR exception will be raised.


.SH SEE ALSO

.B Read

.B EBlowFishError
Exception used to report errors.
