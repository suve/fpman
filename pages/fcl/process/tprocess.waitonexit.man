.SH NAME
TProcess.WaitOnExit - Wait for the program to stop executing.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBprocess\fR, file \fBprocess.pp\fR, line 122
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTProcess.WaitOnExit\fR:Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWaitOnExit\fR waits for the running program to exit. It returns \fBTrue\fR if the wait was succesful, or \fBFalse\fR if there was some error waiting for the program to exit.

Note that the return value of this function has changed. The old return value was a DWord with a platform dependent error code. To make things consistent and cross-platform, a boolean return type was used.


.SH ERRORS
On error, \fBFalse\fR is returned. No extended error information is available, as it is highly system dependent.
