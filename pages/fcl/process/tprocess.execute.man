.SH NAME
TProcess.Execute - Execute the program with the given options
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBprocess\fR, file \fBprocess.pp\fR, line 115
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTProcess.Execute\fR; \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBExecute\fR actually executes the program as specified in \fBCommandLine\fR, applying as much as of the specified options as supported on the current platform.

If the \fBpoWaitOnExit\fR option is specified in \fBOptions\fR, then the call will only return when the program has finished executing (or if an error occured). If this option is not given, the call returns immediatly, but the \fBWaitOnExit\fR call can be used to wait for it to close, or the \fBRunning\fR call can be used to check whether it is still running.

The \fBTProcess.Terminate\fR call can be used to terminate the program if it is still running, or the \fBSuspend\fR call can be used to temporarily stop the program's execution.

The \fBExitStatus\fR function can be used to check the program's exit status, after it has stopped executing.


.SH ERRORS
On error a \fBEProcess\fR exception is raised.
