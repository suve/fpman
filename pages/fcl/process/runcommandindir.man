.SH NAME
RunCommandIndir - Run a command in a specific directory.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBprocess\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBRunCommandIndir\fR(\fBconst\fR curdir:string; \fBconst\fR exename:string; \fBconst\fR commands; \fBvar\fR outputstring:string; \fBvar\fR exitstatus:Integer):Integer;

function \fBRunCommandIndir\fR(\fBconst\fR curdir:string; \fBconst\fR exename:string; \fBconst\fR commands; \fBvar\fR outputstring:string):Boolean;

function \fBRunCommandInDir\fR(\fBconst\fR curdir:string; \fBconst\fR cmdline:string; \fBvar\fR outputstring:string):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRunCommandInDir\fR will execute binary \fBexename\fR with command-line options \fBcommands\fR, setting \fBcurdir\fR as the current working directory for the command. The output of the command is captured, and returned in the string \fBOutputString\fR. The function waits for the command to finish, and returns \fBTrue\fR if the command was started succesfully, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.

If a \fBExitStatus\fR parameter is specified the exit status of the command is returned in this parameter.

The version using \fBcmdline\fR attempts to split the command line in a binary and separate command-line arguments. This version of the function is deprecated.


.SH ERRORS
On error, \fBFalse\fR is returned.
