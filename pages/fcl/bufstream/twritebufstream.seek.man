.SH NAME
TWriteBufStream.Seek - Set stream position.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBbufstream\fR, file \fBbufstream.pp\fR, line 69
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTWriteBufStream.Seek\fR(\fBconst\fR Offset:Int64; Origin:TSeekOrigin):Int64;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSeek\fR always raises an \fBEStreamError\fR exception, except when the seek operation would not alter the current position.

A later implementation may perform a proper seek operation by flushing the buffer and doing a seek on the source stream.
