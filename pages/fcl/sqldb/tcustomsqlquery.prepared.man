.SH NAME
TCustomSQLQuery.Prepared - Is the query prepared ?
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBsqldb\fR, file \fBsqldb.pp\fR, line 383
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTCustomSQLQuery.Prepared\fR: Boolean
  \fBread\fR IsPrepared;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPrepared\fR is true if \fBPrepare\fR was called for this query, and an \fBUnPrepare\fR was not done after that (take care: several actions call \fBUnPrepare\fR implicitly). Initially, \fBPrepared\fR will be \fBFalse\fR. Calling \fBPrepare\fR if the query was already prepared has no effect.

.B TCustomSQLQuery.Prepare
