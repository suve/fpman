.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTCustomSQLStatement\fR is a light-weight object that can be used to execute SQL statements on a database. It does not support result sets, and has none of the methods that a \fBTDataset\fR component has. It can be used to execute SQL statements on a database that update data, execute stored procedures and DDL statements etc.

The \fBTCustomSQLStatement\fR is equivalent to \fBTSQLQuery\fR in that it supports transactions (in the \fBTransaction\fR property) and parameters (in the \fBParams\fR property) and as such is a more versatile tool than executing queries using \fBTSQLConnection.ExecuteDirect\fR.

To use a \fBTCustomSQLStatement\fR is simple and similar to the use of \fBTSQLQuery\fR: set the \fBDatabase\fR property to an existing connection component, and set the \fBTransaction\fR property. After setting the \fBSQL\fR property and filling \fBParams\fR, the SQL statement can be executed with the Execute method.

\fBTCustomSQLStatement\fR is a parent class. Many of the properties are only made public (or published) in the \fBTSQLStatement\fR class, which should be instantiated instead of the \fBTCustomSQLStatement\fR class.
