.SH NAME
TSQLConnector - Universal connection component
.SH LOCATION

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtype\fR TSQLConnector = \fBclass (TSQLConnection)\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTSQLConnector\fR implements a general connection type. When switching database backends, the normal procedure is to replace one instance of \fBTSQLConnection\fR descendent with another, and connect all instances of \fBTSQLQuery\fR and \fBTSQLTransaction\fR to the new connection.

Using \fBTSQLConnector\fR avoids this: the type of connection can be set using the \fBConnectorType\fR property, which is a string property. The \fBTSQLConnector\fR class will (in the background) create the correct \fBTSQLConnection\fR descendent to handle all actual operations on the database.

In all other respects, \fBTSQLConnector\fR acts like a regular \fBTSQLConnection\fR instance. Since no access to the actually used \fBTSQLConnection\fR descendent is available, connection-specific calls are not available.
