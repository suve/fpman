.SH NAME
TSQLStatement.SQL - The SQL statement to execute
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBsqldb\fR, file \fBsqldb.pp\fR, line 287
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property \fBTSQLStatement.SQL\fR: ;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSQL\fR must be set to the SQL statement to execute. It must not be a statement that returns a result set. This is the statement that will be passed on to the database engine when \fBPrepare\fR is called.

If ParamCheck equals \fBTrue\fR (the default), the SQL statement can contain parameter names where literal values can occur, in the form \fB:ParamName\fR. Keywords or table names cannot be specified as parameters. If the underlying database engine supports it, the parameter support of the database will be used to transfer the values from the Params collection. If not, it will be emulated. The \fBParams\fR collection is automatically populated when the SQL statement is set.

Some databases support executing multiple SQL statements in 1 call. Therefor, no attempt is done to ensure that \fBSQL\fR contains a single SQL statement. However, error reporting and the \fBRowsAffected\fR function may be wrong in such a case.
