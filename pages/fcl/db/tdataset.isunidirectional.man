.SH NAME
TDataSet.IsUniDirectional - Is the dataset unidirectional (i.e. forward scrolling only)
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1635
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTDataSet.IsUniDirectional\fR: Boolean
  \fBread\fR FIsUniDirectional;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIsUniDirectional\fR is \fBTrue\fR if the dataset is unidirectional. By default it is \fBFalse\fR, i.e. scrolling backwards is allowed. If the dataset is unidirectional, then any attempt to scroll backwards (using one of \fBTDataset.Prior\fR or \fBTDataset.Next\fR), random positioning of the cursor, editing or filtering will result in an \fBEDatabaseError\fR. Unidirectional datasets are also not suitable for display in a grid, as they have only 1 record in memory at any given time: they are only useful for performing an action on all records:
