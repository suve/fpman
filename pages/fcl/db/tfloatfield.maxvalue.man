.SH NAME
TFloatField.MaxValue - Maximum value for the field
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 654
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property \fBTFloatField.MaxValue\fR: Double
  \fBread\fR FMaxValue
  \fBwrite\fR FMaxValue;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMaxValue\fR can be set to a value different from zero, it is then the maximum value for the field if set to any value different from zero. When setting the field's value, the value may not be larger than \fBMaxValue\fR. Any attempt to write a larger value as the field's content will result in an exception. By default \fBMaxValue\fR equals \fB0\fR, i.e. any floating-point value is allowed.

If \fBMaxValue\fR is set, \fBMinValue\fR should also be set, because it will also be checked.
