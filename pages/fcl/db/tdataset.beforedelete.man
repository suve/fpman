.SH NAME
TDataSet.BeforeDelete - Event triggered before a Delete operation.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1659
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property  \fBTDataSet.BeforeDelete\fR:TDataSetNotifyEvent \\fBread \\fRFBeforeDelete \\fBwrite \\fRFBeforeDelete;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBBeforeDelete\fR is triggered at the start of the \fBTDataset.Delete\fR operation, when the dataset is still in \fBdsBrowse\fR state. The event handler can be used to abort the delete operation: if an exception is raised during the event handler, then the delete operation stops. The event is followed by a \fBTDataset.BeforeScroll\fR event. If the dataset was in insert mode when the \fBDelete\fR method was called, then the event will not be called, as \fBTDataset.Cancel\fR is called instead.
