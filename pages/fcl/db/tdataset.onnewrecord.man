TDataSet.OnNewRecord - Event triggered when a new record is created.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1669
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property  \fBTDataSet.OnNewRecord\fR:TDataSetNotifyEvent \\fBread \\fRFOnNewRecord \\fBwrite \\fRFOnNewRecord;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOnNewRecord\fR is triggered by the \fBTDataset.Append\fR or \fBTDataset.Insert\fR methods when the buffer for the new record's data has been allocated. This event can be used to set default value for some of the fields in the dataset. If an exception is raised during this event handler, the operation is cancelled and the dataset is put again in browse mode (\fBTDataset.State\fR is again \fBdsBrowse\fR).
