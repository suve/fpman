.SH NAME
TField.OnChange - Event triggerd when the field's value has changed
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 444
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property  \fBTField.OnChange\fR:TFieldNotifyEvent \\fBread \\fRFOnChange \\fBwrite \\fRFOnChange;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOnChange\fR is triggered whenever the field's value has been changed. It is triggered only after the new contents have been written to the dataset buffer, so it can be used to react to changes in the field's content. To prevent the writing of changes to the buffer, use the \fBTField.OnValidate\fR event. It is not allowed to change the state of the dataset or the contents of the field during the execution of this event handler: doing so may lead to infinite loops and other unexpected results.
