.SH NAME
TDataSet.AfterInsert - Event triggered after the dataset is put in insert mode.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1652
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTDataSet.AfterInsert\fR: TDataSetNotifyEvent
  \fBread\fR FAfterInsert
  \fBwrite\fR FAfterInsert;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAfterInsert\fR is triggered after the dataset has finished putting the dataset in \fBdsInsert\fR state and it has initialized the new record buffer. This event can be used e.g. to set initial field values. After the \fBAfterinsert\fR event, the \fBTDataset.AfterScroll\fR event is still triggered. Raising an exception in the \fBAfterInsert\fR event, will prevent the \fBAfterScroll\fR event from being triggered, but does not undo the insert or append operation.
