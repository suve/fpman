.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTGraphicField\fR is the class used when a dataset must manage graphical BLOB data. (\fBTField.DataType\fR equals \fBftGraphic\fR). It initializes some of the properties of the \fBTField\fR class. All methods to be able to work with graphical BLOB data have been implemented in the \fBTBlobField\fR parent class.

It should never be necessary to create an instance of \fBTGraphicsField\fR manually, a field of this class will be instantiated automatically for each graphical BLOB field when a dataset is opened.
