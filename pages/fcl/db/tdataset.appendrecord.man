.SH NAME
TDataSet.AppendRecord - Append a new record to the dataset and fill with data
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1575
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTDataSet.AppendRecord\fR(\fBconst\fR Values);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAppendRecord\fR first calls \fBAppend\fR to add a new record to the dataset. It then copies the values in \fBValues\fR to the various fields (using \fBTDataset.SetFields\fR) and attempts to post the record using \fBTDataset.Post\fR. If all went well, the result is that the values in \fBValues\fR have been added as a new record to the dataset.


.SH ERRORS
Various errors may occur (not supplying a value for all required fields, invalid values) and may cause an exception. This may leave the dataset in editing mode.
