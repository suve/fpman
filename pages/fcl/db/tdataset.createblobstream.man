.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1583
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTDataSet.CreateBlobStream\fR(Field:TField; Mode:TBlobStreamMode):TStream; \fBvirtual\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreateBlobStream\fR is not intended for use by applictaion programmers. It creates a stream object which can be used to read or write data from a blob field. Instead, application programmers should use the \fBTBlobField.LoadFromStream\fR and \fBTBlobField.SaveToStream\fR methods when reading and writing data from/to BLOB fields. Which operation must be performed on the stream is indicated in the \fBMode\fR parameter, and the \fBField\fR parameter contains the field whose data should be read. The caller is responsible for freeing the stream created by this function.
