.SH NAME
TField.ReadOnly - Is the field read-only
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 441
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property \fBTField.ReadOnly\fR: Boolean
  \fBread\fR FReadOnly
  \fBwrite\fR SetReadOnly;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReadOnly\fR can be set to \fBTrue\fR to prevent controls of writing data to the field, effectively making it a read-only field. Setting this property to \fBTrue\fR does not prevent the field from getting a value through code: it is just an indication for GUI controls that the field's value is considered read-only.


.SH SEE ALSO
.TP
.B TFieldDef.Attributes
Additional attributes of the field.
