.SH NAME
SkipComments - Skip SQL comments
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 2115
.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBSkipComments\fR(\fBvar\fR p:PChar; EscapeSlash:Boolean; EscapeRepeat:Boolean):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSkipComments\fR examines the null-terminated string in \fBP\fR and skips any SQL comment or string literal found at the start. It returns \fBP\fR the first non-comment or non-string literal position. The \fBEscapeSlash\fR parameter determines whether the backslash character (\\) functions as an escape character (i.e. the following character is not considered a delimiter). \fBEscapeRepeat\fR must be set to \fBTrue\fR if the quote character is repeated to indicate itself.

The function returns \fBTrue\fR if a comment was found and skipped, \fBFalse\fR otherwise.


.SH ERRORS
No checks are done on the validity of \fBP\fR.
