.SH NAME
TField.Required - Does the field require a value
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 442
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property \fBTField.Required\fR: Boolean
  \fBread\fR FRequired
  \fBwrite\fR FRequired;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRequired\fR determines whether the field needs a value when posting the data: when a dataset posts the changed made to a record (new or existing), it will check whether all fields with the \fBRequired\fR property have a value assigned to them. If not, an exception will be raised. Descendents of \fBTDataset\fR will set the property to \fBTrue\fR when opening the dataset, depending on whether the field is required in the underlying data engine. For fields that are not required by the database engine, the programmer can still set the property to \fBTrue\fR if the business logic requires a field.
