.SH NAME
TField.AsWideString - Access the field's contents as a WideString value.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 397
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTField.AsWideString\fR: WideString
  \fBread\fR GetAsWideString
  \fBwrite\fR SetAsWideString;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBAsWideString\fR can be used to read or write the contents of the field as a WideString value. If the native type of the field is not a widestring value, then an attempt will be made to convert the field value from the native format to a widestring value when reading the field's content. Likewise, when writing the property, the value will be converted to the native type of the field (if the value allows it). Therefor, when reading or writing a field value for a field whose native data type is not a widestring-compatible value, an exception may be raised.
