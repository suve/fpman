.SH NAME
TDataSet.Edit - Set the dataset in editing mode.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1588
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTDataSet.Edit\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBEdit\fR will set the dataset in edit mode: the contents of the current record can then be changed. This action will call the \fBTDataset.BeforeEdit\fR and \fBTDataset.AfterEdit\fR events. If the dataset was already in insert or edit mode, nothing will happen (the events will also not be triggered). If the dataset is empty, this action will execute \fBTDataset.Append\fR instead.


.SH ERRORS
If the dataset is read-only or not opened, then an \fBEDatabaseError\fR exception will be raised.
