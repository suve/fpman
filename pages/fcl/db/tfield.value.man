.SH NAME
TField.Value - Value of the field as a variant value
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 419
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property  \fBTField.Value\fR:variant \\fBread \\fRGetAsVariant \\fBwrite \\fRSetAsVariant;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBValue\fR can be used to read or write the value of the field as a Variant value. When setting the value, the value will be converted to the actual type of the field as defined in the underlying data. Likewise, when reading the value property, the actual field value will be converted to a variant value. If the field does not contain a value (when \fBIsNull\fR returns \fBTrue\fR), then \fBValue\fR will contain \fBNull\fR.

It is not recommended to use the \fBValue\fR property: it should only be used when the type of the field is unknown. If the type of the field is known, it is better to use one of the \fBAsXXX\fR properties, which will not only result in faster code, but will also avoid strange type conversions.
