.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTBinaryField\fR is an abstract class, designed to handle binary data of variable size. It overrides some of the properties and methods of the \fBTField\fR class to be able to work with binary field data, such as retrieving the contents as a string or as a variant.

One must never create an instance of \fBTBinaryField\fR manually, it is an abstract class. Instead, a descendent class such as \fBTBytesField\fR or \fBTVarBytesField\fR should be created.
