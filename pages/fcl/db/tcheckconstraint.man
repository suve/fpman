.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTCheckConstraint\fR can be used to store the definition of a record-level constraint. It does not enforce the constraint, it only stores the constraint's definition. The constraint can come from several sources: an imported constraints from the database, usually stored in the \fBTCheckConstraint.ImportedConstraint\fR property, or a constraint enforced by the user on a particular dataset instance stored in \fBTCheckConstraint.CustomConstraint\fR
