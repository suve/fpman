.SH NAME
TDataSet.OnDeleteError - Event triggered when a delete operation fails.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1666
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTDataSet.OnDeleteError\fR: TDataSetErrorEvent
  \fBread\fR FOnDeleteError
  \fBwrite\fR FOnDeleteError;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOnDeleteError\fR is triggered when the \fBTDataset.Delete\fR method fails to delete the record in the underlying database. The event handler can be used to indicate what the response to the failed delete should be. To this end, it gets the exception object passed to it (parameter \fBE\fR), and it can examine this object to return an appropriate action in the \fBDataAction\fR parameter. The following responses are supported:

.TP
.B daFail
The operation should fail (an exception will be raised)
.TP
.B daAbort
The operation should be aborted (edits are undone, and an EAbort exception is raised)
.TP
.B daRetry
Retry the operation.
.TP 0
For more information, see also the description of the \fBTDatasetErrorEvent\fR event handler type.
