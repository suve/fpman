.SH NAME
TDataSet.DisableControls - Disable event propagation of controls
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1587
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTDataSet.DisableControls\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDisableControls\fR tells the dataset to stop sending data-related events to the controls. This can be used before starting operations that will cause the current record to change a lot, or before any other lengthy operation that may cause a lot of events to be sent to the controls that show data from the dataset: each event will cause the control to update itself, which is a time-consuming operation that may also cause a lot of flicker on the screen.

The sending of events to the controls can be re-enabled with \fBTdataset.EnableControls\fR. Note that for each call to \fBDisableControls\fR, a matching call to \fBEnableControls\fR must be made: an internal count is kept and only when the count reaches zero, the controls are again notified of changes to the dataset. It is therefore essential that the call to \fBEnableControls\fR is put in a \fBFinally\fR block:


.SH ERRORS
Failure to call enablecontrols will prevent the controls from receiving updates. The state can be checked with \fBTDataset.ControlsDisabled\fR.
