.SH SYNOPSIS
function \fBBuffersEqual\fR(Buf1:Pointer; Buf2:Pointer; Size:Integer):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBBuffersEqual\fR compares the memory areas pointed to by the \fBBuf1\fR and \fBBuf2\fR pointers and returns \fBTrue\fR if the contents are equal. The memory areas are compared for the first \fBSize\fR bytes. If all bytes in the indicated areas are equal, then \fBTrue\fR is returned, otherwise \fBFalse\fR is returned.

If \fBBuf1\fR or \fBBuf2\fR do not point to a valid memory area or \fBSize\fR is too large, then an exception may occur
