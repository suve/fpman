.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTFieldDefs\fR is used by each \fBTDataset\fR instance to keep a description of the data that it manages; for each field in a record that makes up the underlying data, the \fBTFieldDefs\fR instance keeps an instance of \fBTFieldDef\fR that describes the field's contents. For any internally calculated fields of the dataset, a \fBTFieldDef\fR instance is kept as well. This collection is filled by descendent classes of \fBTDataset\fR as soon as the dataset is opened; it is cleared when the dataset closes. After the collection was populated, the dataset creates \fBTField\fR instances based on all the definitions in the collections. If persistent fields were used, the contents of the fielddefs collection is compared to the field components that are present in the dataset. If the collection contains more field definitions than Field components, these extra fields will not be available in the dataset.
