.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTDatasource\fR is a mediating component: it handles communication between any DB-Aware component (often edit controls on a form) and a \fBTDataset\fR instance. Any database aware component should never communicate with a dataset directly. Instead, it should communicate with a \fBTDatasource\fR instance. The TDataset instance will communicate with the TDatasource instance, which will notify every component attached to it. Vice versa, any component that wishes to make changes to the dataset, will notify the TDatasource instance, which will then (if needed) notify the TDataset instance. The datasource can be disabled, in which case all communication between the dataset and the DB-AWare components is suspended until the datasource is again enabled.
