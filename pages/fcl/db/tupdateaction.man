.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTUpdateAction\fR indicates what action must be taken in case the applying of updates on the underlying database fails. This type is not used in the \fBTDataset\fR class, but is defined on behalf of \fBTDataset\fR descendents that implement caching of updates: It indicates what should be done when the (delayed) applying of the updates fails. This event occurs long after the actual post or delete operation.
