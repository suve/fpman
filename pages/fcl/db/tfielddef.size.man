.SH NAME
TFieldDef.Size - Size of the buffer needed to store the data of the field
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 199
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property \fBTFieldDef.Size\fR: Integer
  \fBread\fR FSize
  \fBwrite\fR SetSize;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSize\fR indicates the size of the buffer needed to hold data for the field. For types with a fixed size (such as integer, word or data/time) the size can be zero: the buffer mechaism reserves automatically enough heap memory. For types which can have various sizes (blobs, string types), the Size property tells the buffer mechanism how many bytes are needed to hold the data for the field. For BCD fields, the size property indicates the number of decimals after the decimal separator.
