.SH NAME
TFields.CheckFieldNames - Check a list of field names for duplicate entries
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR, file \fBdb.pas\fR, line 1096
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTFields.CheckFieldNames\fR(\fBconst\fR Value:string);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCheckFieldNames\fR splits \fBValue\fR in a list of fieldnames, using semicolon as a separator. For each of the fieldnames obtained in this way, it calls \fBCheckFieldName\fR.
