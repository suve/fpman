.SH NAME
TField.SetData - Save the field data
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdb\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
public procedure \fBTField.SetData\fR(Buffer:Pointer);

procedure \fBTField.SetData\fR(Buffer:Pointer; NativeFormat:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSetData\fR saves the value of the field data in \fBBuffer\fR to the dataset internal buffer. The \fBBuffer\fR pointer should point to a memory buffer containing the data for the field in the correct format. If the \fBNativeFormat\fR parameter is true, then date/time formats should use the \fBTDateTime\fR format.

There should normally not be any need to call \fBSetData\fR directly: it is called by the various setter methods of the AsXXX properties of \fBTField\fR.


.SH ERRORS
No validity checks are performed on \fBBuffer\fR : it should point to a valid memory area, and should be large enough to contain the value of the field. Failure to provide a buffer that matches these criteria will result in an exception.
