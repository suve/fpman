.SH NAME
TDBDataset - Dataset connected to a database.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTDBDataset\fR is a \fBTDataset\fR descendent which introduces the concept of a database: a central component (\fBTDatabase\fR) which represents a connection to a database. This central component is exposed in the \fBTDBDataset.Database\fR property. When the database is no longer connected, or is no longer in memory, all \fBTDBDataset\fR instances connected to it are disabled.

\fBTDBDataset\fR also introduces the notion of a transaction, exposed in the \fBTransaction\fR property.

\fBTDBDataset\fR is an abstract class, it should never be used directly.

Dataset component writers should descend their component from \fBTDBDataset\fR if they wish to introduce a central database connection component. The database connection logic will be handled automatically by \fBTDBDataset\fR.
