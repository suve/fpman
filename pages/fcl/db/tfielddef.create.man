constructor \fBTFieldDef.Create\fR(AOwner:TFieldDefs; \fBconst\fR AName:string; ADataType:TFieldType; ASize:Integer; ARequired:Boolean; AFieldNo:LongInt);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreate\fR is the constructor for the \fBTFieldDef\fR class.

If a simple call is used, with a single argument \fBACollection\fR, the inherited \fBCreate\fR is called and the Field number is set to the incremented current index.

If the more complicated call is used, with multiple arguments, then after the inherited \fBCreate\fR call, the Name, \fBdatatype\fR, \fBsize\fR, \fBprecision\fR, \fBFieldNo\fR and the \fBRequired\fR property are all set according to the passsed arguments.
