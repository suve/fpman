.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTIOStream\fR can be used to create a stream which reads from or writes to the standard input, output or stderr file descriptors. It is a descendent of \fBTHandleStream\fR. The type of stream that is created is determined by the \fBTIOSType\fR argument to the constructor. The handle of the standard input, output or stderr file descriptors is determined automatically.

The \fBTIOStream\fR keeps an internal \fBPosition\fR, and attempts to provide minimal \fBSeek\fR behaviour based on this position.
