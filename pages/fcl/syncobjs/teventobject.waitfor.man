.SH NAME
TEventObject.WaitFor - Wait for the event to be set.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBsyncobjs\fR, file \fBsyncobjs.pp\fR, line 70
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTEventObject.WaitFor\fR(Timeout:Cardinal):TWaitResult;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWaitFor\fR should be used in threads that should be notified when the event is set. When \fBWaitFor\fR is called, and the event is not set, the thread will be suspended. As soon as the event is set by some other thread (using \fBSetEvent\fR) or the timeout period (\fBTimeOut\fR) has expired, the \fBWaitFor\fR function returns. The return value depends on the condition that caused the \fBWaitFor\fR function to return.

The calling thread will wait indefinitely when the constant \fBINFINITE\fR is specified for the \fBTimeOut\fR parameter.
