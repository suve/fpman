.SH NAME
TEventLog.EventIDOffset - Offset for event ID messages identifiers
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBeventlog\fR, file \fBeventlog.pp\fR, line 100
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property  \fBTEventLog.EventIDOffset\fR:DWord \\fBread \\fRFEventIDOffset \\fBwrite \\fRFEventIDOffset;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBEventIDOffset\fR is the offset for the message formatting strings in the windows resource file. This property is ignored on other platforms.

The message strings in the file registered with the \fBRegisterMessageFile\fR call are windows resource strings. They each have a unique ID, which must be communicated to windows. In the resource file distributed by Free Pascal, the resource strings are numbered from 1000 to 1004. The actual number communicated to windows is formed by adding the ordinal value of the message's eventtype to \fBEventIDOffset\fR (which is by default 1000), which means that by default, the string numbers are:
