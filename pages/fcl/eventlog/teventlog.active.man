.SH NAME
TEventLog.Active - Activate the log mechanism
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBeventlog\fR, file \fBeventlog.pp\fR, line 94
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property  \fBTEventLog.Active\fR:Boolean \\fBread \\fRFActive \\fBwrite \\fRSetActive;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBActive\fR determines whether the log mechanism is active: if set to \fBTrue\fR, the component connects to the system log mechanism, or opens the log file if needed. Any attempt to log a message while the log is not active will try to set this property to \fBTrue\fR. Disconnecting from the system log or closing the log file is done by setting the \fBActive\fR property to \fBFalse\fR.

If the connection to the system logger fails, or the log file cannot be opened, then setting this property may result in an exception.
