.SH NAME
TGZFileStream.write - Write data to be compressed
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBzstream\fR, file \fBzstream.pp\fR, line 91
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTGZFileStream.write\fR(\fBconst\fR buffer; count:LongInt):LongInt; \fBoverride\fR;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWrite\fR writes \fBCount\fR bytes from \fBBuffer\fR to the compressed file. The data is compressed as it is written, so ideally, less than \fBCount\fR bytes end up in the compressed file. Note that it is not possible to write to the stream if it was opened in read mode.

The function returns the number of (uncompressed) bytes that were actually written.


.SH ERRORS
In case of an error, an \fBEZlibError\fR exception is raised.
