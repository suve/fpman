.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTOrderedList\fR provides the base class for \fBTQueue\fR and \fBTStack\fR. It provides an interface for pushing and popping elements on or off the list, and manages the internal list of pointers.

Note that \fBTOrderedList\fR does not manage objects on the stack, i.e. objects are not freed when the ordered list is destroyed.
