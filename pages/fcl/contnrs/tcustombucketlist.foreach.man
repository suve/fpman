.SH NAME
TCustomBucketList.ForEach - Loop over all items.
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBcontnrs\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
public function \fBTCustomBucketList.ForEach\fR(AProc:TBucketProc; AInfo:Pointer):Boolean;

function \fBTCustomBucketList.ForEach\fR(AProc:TBucketProcObject):Boolean;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBForeach\fR loops over all items in the list and calls \fBAProc\fR, passing it in turn each item in the list.

\fBAProc\fR exists in 2 variants: one which is a simple procedure, and one which is a method. In the case of the simple procedure, the \fBAInfo\fR argument is passed as well in each call to \fBAProc\fR.

The loop stops when all items have been processed, or when the \fBAContinue\fR argument of \fBAProc\fR contains \fBFalse\fR on return.

The result of the function is \fBTrue\fR if all items were processed, or \fBFalse\fR if the loop was interrupted with a \fBAContinue\fR return of \fBFalse\fR.


.SH ERRORS
None.
