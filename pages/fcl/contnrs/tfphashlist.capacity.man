.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBcontnrs\fR, file \fBcontnrs.pp\fR, line 252
.SH SYNOPSIS
public property \fBTFPHashList.Capacity\fR: Integer
  \fBread\fR FCapacity
  \fBwrite\fR SetCapacity;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCapacity\fR returns the current capacity of the list. The capacity is expanded as more elements are added to the list. If a good estimate of the number of elements that will be added to the list, the property can be set to a sufficiently large value to avoid reallocation of memory each time the list needs to grow.
