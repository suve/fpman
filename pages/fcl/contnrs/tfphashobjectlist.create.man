.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBcontnrs\fR, file \fBcontnrs.pp\fR, line 299
.SH SYNOPSIS
public constructor \fBTFPHashObjectList.Create\fR(FreeObjects:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreate\fR creates a new instance of \fBTFPHashObjectList\fR on the heap and sets the hash capacity to 1.

If \fBFreeObjects\fR is \fBTrue\fR (the default), then the list owns the objects: when an object is removed from the list, it is destroyed (freed from memory). Clearing the list will free all objects in the list.
