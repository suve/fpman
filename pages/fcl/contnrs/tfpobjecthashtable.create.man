.SH NAME
TFPObjectHashTable.Create - Create a new instance of \fBTFPObjectHashTable\fR 
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBcontnrs\fR, file \fBcontnrs.pp\fR, line 471
.SH SYNOPSIS
public constructor \fBTFPObjectHashTable.Create\fR(AOwnsObjects:Boolean);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCreate\fR creates a new instance of \fBTFPObjectHashTable\fR on the heap. It sets the \fBOwnsObjects\fR property to \fBAOwnsObjects\fR, and then calls the inherited \fBCreate\fR. If \fBAOwnsObjects\fR is set to \fBTrue\fR, then the hash table owns the objects: whenever an object is removed from the list, it is automatically freed.


.SH ERRORS
If not enough memory is available on the heap, an exception may be raised.
