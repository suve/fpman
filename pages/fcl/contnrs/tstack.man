.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTStack\fR is a descendent of \fBTOrderedList\fR which implements \fBPush\fR and \fBPop\fR behaviour as a stack: what is last pushed on the stack, is popped of first (LIFO: Last in, first out).

\fBTStack\fR offers no new methods, it merely implements some abstract methods introduced by \fBTOrderedList\fR
