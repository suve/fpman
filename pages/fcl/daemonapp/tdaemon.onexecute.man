.SH NAME
TDaemon.OnExecute - Daemon execute event
.SH LOCATION
package \fBfcl\fR, unit \fBdaemonapp\fR, file \fBdaemonapp.pp\fR, line 108
.SH SYNOPSIS
published property  \fBTDaemon.OnExecute\fR:TDaemonEvent \\fBread \\fRFOnExecute \\fBwrite \\fRFOnExecute;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOnExecute\fR is executed once after the daemon was started. If assigned, it should perform whatever operation the daemon is designed.

If the daemon's action is event based, then no \fBOnExecute\fR handler is needed, and the events will control the daemon's execution: the daemon thread will then go in a loop, passing control messages to the daemon.

If an \fBOnExecute\fR event handler is present, the checking for control messages must be done by the implementation of the \fBOnExecute\fR handler.
